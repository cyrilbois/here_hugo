# intro
The idea of a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page was introduced to me by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). There's many lovely [examples](https://nownownow.com/) on the web of how these pages look.

> Think of what youâ€™d tell a friend you hadnâ€™t seen in a year.

## Topics I'm currently obsessed with 
- [Architecture]({{<ref "/tags/architecture">}}) - recently [AWS certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/9342a916-83b2-489e-969a-aa43af8a0c77) ðŸ˜„. [Related notes here]({{<ref "/tags/aws">}})
- [UX]({{<ref "/tags/ux">}})
- [Agile & software delivery]({{<ref "/tags/agile">}}) - How teams build & deliver software; [product development]({{<ref "/tags/product">}}) - a natural extension of the [devops]({{<ref "/tags/devops">}}) topic tbh
  - [Team Topologies]({{<ref team-topologies>}})


# Frontend Engineering work for [Flexperto](https://flexperto.com/en/)
Surrounded by very talented people I learn from everyday.

# curating music
another crucial part of my daily life, I have been actively [curating]({{<ref "/tags/curated" >}}) music since almost as far back as memory can take me.

it's become slightly more systemic & efficient, & I'm always looking for ways to improve on it. I enjoy this so much.

- Recording and uploading [DJ mixes]({{<ref mix>}}) ~~every other Sunday, at sunset~~.
- Building & writing music content on [goosebumps.fm](https://goosebumps.fm)
