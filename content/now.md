# intro
The idea of a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page was introduced to me by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). There's many lovely [examples](https://nownownow.com/) on the web of how these pages look.

## Topics I'm currently obsessed with

- UX
- Cloud, infra, devops, security
- How teams build & deliver software; product development - a natural extension of the devops topic tbh
  - Team Topologies
- Typescript
- Testing
- Domain Driven Design
- Project Management
- Agile
