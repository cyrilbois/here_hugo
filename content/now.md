# intro
The idea of a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page was introduced to me by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). There's many lovely [examples](https://nownownow.com/) on the web of how these pages look.

# what I'm up to
- working towards being a well rounded software engineer.
- given that I'm pretty confident with my frontend skill now(2 years active experience as of **Dec '21**), I'm putting more efforts into backend/cloud work, & general, evergreen engineering knowledge.
