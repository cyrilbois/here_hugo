## why does this site exist?

> email is where keystrokes goes to die
> I often have thoughts that I want to share with more than one person, this makes it easier to do that.

a way to start structuring & sharing my longform & random thoughts, so the topics will vary a lot.

this is literally my notebook. that said, assume everything is a work in progress.
