description: My values, and how that translates to my preferred ways of working & communicating
tldr: A communications readme is a great and easy way to share your preferred ways of working with your colleagues. It removes ambiguities and helps to improve relationships. 🤝

# Async by default

* I prefer to work async by default, sync when necessary - such as pair programming, debugging, brainstorm sessions, helping unblock someone
* this may sometimes mean my work hours are not the same as yours, so please don’t feel pressured to respond to my queries outside of your work hours.
* True insight comes when I'm not in a sync environment. This means I often take notes while walking, gyming, shower, and many other places outside of the usual work environment. It's easier to connect and put thoughts together after letting things ponder for a bit.
* Async by default creates artifacts (written documents, diagrams, and other illustrative stuff) that others can refer to in the future, preserving institutional knowledge & context beyond one or a few people's heads

# Flow state & uninterrupted time
- I'm most effective with large blocks of uninterrupted time, because of that, it may seem like I'm not a fan of meetings, and will opt for async communication as default. This seems to work well when paired with ad-hoc meetings
- I do not like to multi-task, context switching is expensive for me as it takes quite some effort for me to transition into a task. While I have gotten better at it, I still tend to stay away. That's why I like to start and take tasks to completion before taking on new stuff.
## Notifications off by default
* Notifications are off by default, I mostly work in pomodoro sessions, meaning I don't respond to messages in real time. I like to [make an optimum environment for sustained periods of flow state]({{<ref nesting>}}).

# Managing energy vs time
- While I find routine important, I find myself being more effective when I manage my energy, as opposed to time. This may often result in inconsistent working hours. Hence the prefernce for an async by default style.

### Meetings
- This also means I don't expect myself to write much code on meeting heavy days like Wednesdays, because I know meetings sap quite a bit of energy out of me, and fragment the day into unusable time chunks for me.

### Downtime
> I believe in “clean” downtime, as in: time off where you go firmly offline work-wise. Make sure you spend enough of your vacation days this way; it’s valuable, healthy, and important.
> - [Isaac Hepworth](https://github.com/hepwori/wwi/)

I endorse this statement 100%. I don't have slack on my phone, so when I'm AFK without the laptops, I'm truly away.

# Learning
- I deeply value learning time, as it allows me to be self-indulgent, and grow professionally, as a lot of the concepts are transferable to the workplace. it also alleviates the feeling of burn out, because it's the kind of work that's fully in my control.
- Important for a sustainable career imo
- Loving the hackathon Fridays!

# WIP, Early & Often Collaboration
> I’m happy to see messy or work-in-progress ideas or materials as we get there

- Read my post [on PR's & WIP]({{<ref on-prs>}}) for insight on this.
# Fun facts
- Big music fan! One of my serious hobbies is curating music, always happy to chat music. I'm curating a dub techno playlist/mix while writing this doc :)
- I love sim racing, I'm currently playing Dirt Rally 2
