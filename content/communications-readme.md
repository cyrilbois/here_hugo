description: my preferred ways of working & communicating
tldr: A communications readme is a great and easy way to share your preferred ways of working with your colleagues. It removes ambiguities and helps to improve relationships. ü§ù

* I prefer to work async by default, sync only if completely necessary. this is my most efficient state
    * this may sometimes mean my work hours are not the same as yours, so please don‚Äôt feel pressured to respond to my queries outside of your work hours.
* while i have gotten better at it context switching is expensive for me, tires me out quickly, and is pretty inefficient for me. because of this, i‚Äôm a serial monotasker. that works quite well for me.
* I have no notifications for all my work related chat apps, which means I see things at my time, & not instantly. Best bet is to call me if it's an emergency, which tbh, it rarely ever is ;).

### Discord status decoded
Discord is my main chat app. *unrelated but related joke, a rude teenager said to me "slack is basically discord for boomers"* üòÇ

- **Online (green)**: I'm chatty catty, if we're working on a project together, you'll get a reasonably quick reply from me when in this state.
- **Idle (orange)**: Either means I got my phone on me, or have discord open in the background. Usually available for casual, async chat, when in this mode.
- **Do Not Disturn (red)**: I'm in focus mode, usually 1 hour long pomodoros. Very unlikely to get a response until I'm out of this mode
- **Unavailable (greyed out)**: Discord is most likely to be closed on all devices when I'm in this state, with no notifications.
