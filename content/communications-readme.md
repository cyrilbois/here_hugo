* I prefer to work async by default, sync only if completely necessary. this is my most efficient state
    * this may sometimes mean my work hours are not the same as yours, so please don‚Äôt feel pressured to respond to my queries outside of your work hours.
* while i have gotten better at it context switching is expensive for me, tires me out quickly, and is pretty inefficient for me. because of this, i‚Äôm a serial monotasker. that works quite well for me.
