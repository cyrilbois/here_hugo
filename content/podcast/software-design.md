## on complexity

described at an intuitive level, complexity is:
> anything that makes it hard to do your job

- also see [cognitive load](cognitive-load-theory.md) associated with doing the work
- unknown unknowns:

> anytime I have to do anything I have to read every line of code.

- the goal is to reduce the overall complexity of the system
- John is pro small incremental changes as you work in a codebase

> if you take one thing (in attempt to reduce complexity) and push it to the extreme, youâ€™ll probably end up in a bad place
