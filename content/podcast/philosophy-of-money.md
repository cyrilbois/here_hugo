* **Durability**: "it's not going to corrode over time." gold for example

#### life, liberty, property
The foundation of USA, borrowed from the [Magna Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta). important to keep in mind how the central bank relates, especially to the 3rd one, **property**. property rights of some, are arbitrarily violated, to enhance the property rights of others.
  - Andrew Jackson

- **Life**: Our future, to lose your life is to lose your future
- **Liberty**: Is your freedom, to lose your liberty is to become a slave, and there's a spectrum to it. 0% tax or theft, is a free man; 100% tax or theft is a slave - all teh fruits of your labour go to someone else.
- **Property**: your past, how you've spent your past infusing nature with your life & liberty. you've accumulated fruits of your labor, that becomes your property
