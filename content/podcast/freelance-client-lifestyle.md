## requirements gathering 
- find out upfront who's going to be doing the content updates. 

## quotes
- indicate how long a quote is valid for
- when presenting a quote, tell them what tech will be used, & why.
- what is being built, as well as what isn't. ^65c817


## timelines & deadlines
- have hard time lines - actual dates
- give clients dates/deadlines for content etc.
- state clearly that your timeline is dependent on their delivery on their deadlines
- assuming they give 24hr turn around time on any questions/feedback that you need from them.
- if you blow this timeline, I have to start another job and our project could just drag on forever.


`underpromise, overdeliver`

- when it comes to estimating time, add 20-30% of whatever you initially think it'll take, because we tend to be too optimistic.
- on setting expectations - I do emails once a day

## design
- collect all assets - logo, brand guidelines
- inspiration from client
-  *at this point create initial look & feel* 
	- home page, typography, think global styles
	- be cautious about showing clients design that is too general & too skeleton. remember Scott's example of the A/B testing at Ford, the design had just 3 cars, and one dude said hey, this has no Mustang, and I like the Mustang, therefore I hate everything about your design. clients generally have similar mindset.

## development
- like design, don't show progress too soon, you don't want to be getting a huge laundry list of things you already know you need to do.
- give regular progress updates. **establish these beforehand**

> do not give me feedback yet, I'm still working at it, I just thought I'd let you into the progress.

## feedback & revisions
- 3 rounds of feedback. have your client go through & ask for one email with a list of feedback.

## deployment
- get client to pay for domains & hosting.
- don't use godaddy, lol. they were at some point injecting tracking scripts on top of **all** sites they were hosting. 
- robots.txt so that the staging site doesn't get indexed if its sensitive information.
- backup strategies, especially when there's databases involved.

## hand-off
- only teach them the things that are important for day to day usage.
- create a video detailing how to do each thing.

## bug fixes & support
> for the next year, if anything breaks because of my own doing, I will fix it for free. however if it's outside of my control, it will be billed separately.
- emergency bugs require an emergency response if they are your fault.

## what to do when things go to shit
- avoid 'scatterbrains' ðŸ˜‚
