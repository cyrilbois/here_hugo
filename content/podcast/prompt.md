# Tweets
Tweets can act as a prompt for topics to write on. Sometimes when I think of something to tweet, I notice that it’s probably something I can flesh out more, then skip the tweet thing, and go straight to my note book.

Decent number of writing on this site started off as would be tweets :)

- Did a friend or colleague ask you a technical question? one that you’re capable of answering? put the answer on your blog!
