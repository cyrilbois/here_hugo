I'm used to hearing network effects being mentioned in the context of social networks (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc).
This podcast goes into network effects in a marketplace & SaaS context.

A marketplace has 2 actors, vaguely summarised here as providers/producers & consumers. A few examples:

| **Product** | **Provider** | **Consumer** |
|---|---|---|
| Uber Eats | Restaurant | Hungry human |
| Amazon | Shop/Vendor | Buyer |
| Spotify | Artist | Fan |


## Different types of Network Effects
1. Direct network effects: Every additional user makes the product better for all existing users. Most common. Social networks would fall in this category.
2. Cross-site network effects: Adding a user on one side of the network makes it better for users on the other side of the network. Marketplaces & SaaS' network effects fall in this category.
3. Data network effects: The quality of something improves as more data is collected. A good example of this is Spotify or Youtube's music recommendation algorithms.
