## context
these are notes from a podcast [Ronny](https://ronnypries.de/) shared with me after I ranted to him about not knowing what to do with myself on a free Saturday morning. great chat, we had.

- episode #89 of [this show](https://www.ubkhappyfuntimehour.com)

## journal
- journal before bed & upon waking up. 
This is a way of closing open loops, and staying mindful about your days

## meditation
- it's not about emptying your mind completely for 30 minutes straight, that's an unreasonable ask
- the practice is more about learning how to come back to your mantra or surroundings for even as little as 3 - 5 seconds at a time. do that over and over
- when you notice your mind starting to wander, acknowledge it, gently nudge yourself back to why you're here

## recharge
- lay in bed, in complete silence if possible
- close your eyes, make the room dark etc
- as much sensory deprivation as possible
- try this for like 10 minutes. magical
- helpful when you're switching contexts, eg going from work gears to creative mode

## small wins
- accumulating small wins helps build momentum
- momentum combats **the resistance**
- momentum results in progress
- small wins is about practicing the executive function muscle
- a quick example: instead of letting the dishes 'soak' after use, clean that shit up when you're done, lol.
- you generally feel good and capable of more as you accumulate these small wins

# related reading
- a big part of the narrative in this episode reminded me of [The War of Art](https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/).

excerpt from a text I sent:
> The war of art should be re-titled “Resistance” 😂random thought I had earlier. that’s the core topic of the book, for me at least
