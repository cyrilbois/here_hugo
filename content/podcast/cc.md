- An engine is a good example of complicated.
If something is broken, we can use process and past 
knowledge to diagnose a fix.

- Whereas venturing into an unknown area is complex 
as you can't just rely on standards, procedures, and 
past knowledge.

- **key take away:** Lots of businesses try to solve
complex problems with mental models from solving 
complicated problems.


## Standards vs Defaults
- Standard: "This is the way we solve the problem, and everyone agrees on it"
- Default: "If you don't know any better, try this"
- [ ] Shuhari framework?

## on Metrics

- Metrics are a proxy for reality, not the whole story.
easy for them to miss nuance.
