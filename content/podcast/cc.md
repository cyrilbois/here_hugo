## Complicated
- An engine is a good example of complicated.
If something is broken, we can use process and past 
knowledge to diagnose a fix.
 - A complicated system has a cause & effect relationship between its components.
 - This implies predictability. It's a knowable thing

## Complex
- Whereas venturing into an unknown area is complex 
as you can't just rely on standards, procedures, and 
past knowledge.
- Examples include weather, traffic, immune system
- They are **dispositional systems**, they operate in a vector space. Although we have 
an idea that `x` will happen because things are trending in that way, we can't fully predict what'll happen.

# Key take away:
Lots of businesses try to solve
complex problems with mental models from solving 
complicated problems.


## Standards vs Defaults
- Standard: "This is the way we solve the problem, and everyone agrees on it"
- Default: "If you don't know any better, try this"
- [ ] Shuhari framework?

## on Metrics

- Metrics are a proxy for reality, not the whole story.
easy for them to miss nuance.

## Behind the scenes
Listened to this on 19 April 2023 - or at least, that's when I made the handwritten notes.
I just found that handwritten note while doing a little bit of tidying up and decided it was worth persisting on the internet
