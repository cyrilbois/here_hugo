## What is useEffect cleanup about?

Thutoâ€™s description helped me grok it much better than the docs:

> Usually with your clean up function in yourÂ useEffect, you would beÂ *deleting*Â (lack of a better word) and canceling any async calls which might come back and find that the component no longer exists.

Perfectly illustrates how a memory leak can happen

# React Native Component/Screen unmounting
- in react-native, screens donâ€™t always unmount. This is dependent on how you do your routing. 
  - be weary of this when relying on useeffect cleanup 
- I think components do unmount, I donâ€™t have a deterministic description of this yet
## ðŸ”¥: Hereâ€™s how you can quickly check if the file youâ€™re working on unmounts or not

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
return () => console.log('I just unmounted')
}, [])
```

## Things you might want to clean up
- Event listeners
- DB connections
- web socket connections
- timers like `setInterval`


## useEffect alternatives
- use an event handling function instead
- React Query pattern is good
  * `const {data, error, isLoading} = someFunction()`
  * this declaration is done at the top level of the component
  * `someFunction()` can be a hook, util function, or an abstraction that exists only in the component calling it
  * does this work well with async?
