# Notes
- LLM vs Diffusion model (Things like midjourney)
  - [Paper Break: HyperDreambooth](https://aibits.substack.com/p/paper-break-hyperdreambooth)

## Traditional vs Semantic search
- Traditional search matches for keywords, and doesn't consider context
- Semantic on the other hand, tries to understand the intent behind your query
  - Querying 'big cats' via some semantic search will give you lions, tigers etc
  instead of exact word matches.
- Embeddings and vectors help make semantic search possible.
- 

## Embeddings and vectors
- Scott describes this better than I can, for now
