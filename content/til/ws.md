# Websockets

- URL protocol used isnâ€™t `http` or `https`, it is instead `ws://` or `wss://`
- `wss://` is websockets over TLS, same way `https` is.
- With http, the comms are one way in that server can only respond to an HTTP req initiated by the client, whereas with websockets, the server can also initiate comms

> In a WebSocket request, a client requests that once HTTP connection is established, the server shouldÂ *Upgrade*
Â to WebSocket connection, as defined in theÂ *Connection*
Â header

### Basic ws request example

```jsx
GET ws://websocket.example.com/ HTTP/1.1
Origin: http://example.com
Connection: Upgrade
Host: websocket.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
```

- The header `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` allows you to specify the sub-protocol that your web-socket connection intends on using. describes the data formats youâ€™ll be using.
    - soap
    - wamp
    - mqtt

### Frames

`ws` communication happens using frames, and there are many different kinds of frames.

- Text frames
- binary data frames
- ping/pong frames - which check whether a connection is still alive

> WebSocketÂ `.send()`Â method can send either text or binary data.

# useState

- If itâ€™s derived state, try to [avoid useState all together](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/dont-over-use-state)

> The initial value of a useState hook is always discarded on re-renders - it only has an effect when the component mounts.
