I can't believe how much I suffered trying to find out IP addresses & such
inside my docker containersðŸ˜‚ - there's no `ipconfig` or `ifconfig` in there.

I'm still trying to get two containers playing well together, using docker
compose. Hopefully will come right soon.

Anyway, onto what we actually learnt while browsing _the youtubes_

---

- `docker inspect [container-id]``
- docker volumes
- pulling docker images
- `docker logs -f``
- `docker system prune --force --volumes``


## Dockerfile
exposing docker ports. What's the difference between these two configs?
```yml
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    expose:
      - "4000"
```
