## Basic Networking
Spent some time having to debug VPN issues, had to monitor performance, & constantly check the routing table
- `ip r` - shows your routing table
> ip - show / manipulate routing, devices, policy routing and tunnels


- `iperf3` - we used this to test the bandwidth between my machine & VPN server
> iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6).

- While chatting networking with Maksim, I learnt about the concept of [deep packet inspection](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-deep-packet-inspection-how-it-works-use-cases-dpi-and-more). that fits right into my [security]({{<ref "resource/security">}}) notes. These could use a little more love tbh.

## More Vim Motions
- `Shift + G` - Takes you to end of file
- `gg` takes you to the beginning of a file
- `ctrl + u` moves you up half a page
- guess what `ctrl + d` does? that's right, moves you down half a page
- Also, found a noice [vim cheatsteet](https://vimsheet.com/)
