## Modifying folder `git config`
So, just som egeneral housekeeping, needed a the repo with this site to use my personal git details, and not the global ones. Had to [edit the repo's git config](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8801729/is-it-possible-to-have-different-git-configuration-for-different-projects#:~:text=There%20are%203%20levels%20of,user%20and%20stored%20in%20~%2F.)
- `./git/config` - notice how this file has no extension

## Service Mesh
A way for services to communicate with each other.
- Service Mesh **sidecar proxies** are a thing. They're what hijack the requests coming in & out of the pod
> Service-to-service communication is what makes microservices possible.

> Dedicated infrastructure layer for service to service communication

- This layer comes with a bunch of features we can opt into, without having to write extra code. Features such as:
  - Auth between services
  - TLS & auto rotation of certificates
  - Metrics & logging: requests per second, latency, and more?
  - Retry logic
  - Auto backoff
- configured in a `yaml`file
