## How I saw it being used
- usability testing report by Jamie
- Outline learnings from Jamieâ€™s work.

## src
- the youtube video that I watched
  - outline the stuff learnt in that video
    - sample error etc
    - maybe also look into the other videos, like methods of sampling. Interesting because Accelerate wrote quite extensively about their sampling methods.
- also make sure to watch the sampling video.
