# Authentication vs Authorization
- Authentication
	1. Checking if a user exists
	2. This is the first step in any security process. 

- Authorization
	1. Comes into play when authorizing a user for private/protected routes.
	2. This term is often used interchangeably with access control or client privilege.

Authorization comes after authentication in my understanding.

> Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource.
