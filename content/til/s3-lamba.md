## 2 S3 buckets
- one to hold **source images**
- the other for **processed images**

## IAM Role for Lambda function
- We use a policy document to specify permissions for this one
- This is done by creating an inline policy, in the `role details` page

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::REPLACEME-processed",
                "arn:aws:s3:::REPLACEME-processed/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::REPLACEME-source/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::REPLACEME-source"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "logs:CreateLogGroup",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:YOURACCOUNTID:*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:YOURACCOUNTID:log-group:/aws/lambda/pixelator:*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Create Lambda deployment zip
- This is to add python dependencies that are not available in the default python runtime environment in the lambdas. 
  - Namely: 
   ```py
      from PIL import Image 
    ```

- First download & unzip `PIL` into folder with `lambda_function.py`
- delete the downloaded zip with PIL
- zip your working directory (lamda_function.py & the unzipped PIL stuff) and that's it. `zip -r ../my-deployment-package.zip .`

## The laambda function ([inside joke context](https://youtube.com/shorts/csVrcFnintA?feature=share))
- create the ting
- upload deployment zip
- create environment variables
- change the timeout from **default of 3 sec** to a more appropriate for this use case, 1 minute.
- our **trigger is an object create event from S3** - this is what invokes the function
> **Recursive invocation**
>If your function writes objects to an S3 bucket, ensure that you are using different S3 buckets for input and output. Writing to the same bucket increases the risk of creating a recursive invocation, which can result in increased Lambda usage and increased costs

# The python code

```py
import os
import json
import uuid
import boto3

from PIL import Image

# bucketname for pixelated images
processed_bucket=os.environ['processed_bucket']

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
	print(event)
	
	# get bucket and object key from event object
	source_bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
	key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
	
	# Generate a temp name, and set location for our original image
	object_key = str(uuid.uuid4()) + '-' + key
	img_download_path = '/tmp/{}'.format(object_key)
	
	# Download the source image from S3 to temp location within execution environment
	with open(img_download_path,'wb') as img_file:
		s3_client.download_fileobj(source_bucket, key, img_file)
		
	# Biggify the pixels and store temp pixelated versions
	pixelate((8,8), img_download_path, '/tmp/pixelated-8x8-{}'.format(object_key) )
	pixelate((16,16), img_download_path, '/tmp/pixelated-16x16-{}'.format(object_key) )
	pixelate((32,32), img_download_path, '/tmp/pixelated-32x32-{}'.format(object_key) )
	pixelate((48,48), img_download_path, '/tmp/pixelated-48x48-{}'.format(object_key) )
	pixelate((64,64), img_download_path, '/tmp/pixelated-64x64-{}'.format(object_key) )
	
	# uploading the pixelated version to destination bucket
	upload_key = 'pixelated-{}'.format(object_key)
	s3_client.upload_file('/tmp/pixelated-8x8-{}'.format(object_key), processed_bucket,'pixelated-8x8-{}'.format(key))
	s3_client.upload_file('/tmp/pixelated-16x16-{}'.format(object_key), processed_bucket,'pixelated-16x16-{}'.format(key))
	s3_client.upload_file('/tmp/pixelated-32x32-{}'.format(object_key), processed_bucket,'pixelated-32x32-{}'.format(key))
	s3_client.upload_file('/tmp/pixelated-48x48-{}'.format(object_key), processed_bucket,'pixelated-48x48-{}'.format(key))
	s3_client.upload_file('/tmp/pixelated-64x64-{}'.format(object_key), processed_bucket,'pixelated-64x64-{}'.format(key))
	
def pixelate(pixelsize, image_path, pixelated_img_path):
	img = Image.open(image_path)
	temp_img = img.resize(pixelsize, Image.BILINEAR)
	new_img = temp_img.resize(img.size, Image.NEAREST)
	new_img.save(pixelated_img_path)
```
