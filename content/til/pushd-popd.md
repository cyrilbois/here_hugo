while taking care of cypress tests running on github actions, I had to do some quick reading on [pushd](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pushd-command-in-linux-with-examples/) as it was part of a build script, but it wouldn't work in the `ci`'s shell.

I had to understand what it was before changing to `cd` to get the job done, was fun to be doing some *'linux'* related reading.
