## What Hugo CLI offers 
Hugo has a very helpful feature included in it's cli, it's the `hugo new` command, and when combined with [archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/), it can save you a lot of time if you're constantly making new markdown files, like I am for this site.

## How I've been using it
when I want to make a new `TIL` article, all I have to type in the cli is 

```bash
hugo new til/hugo-mount-config.md
```

and I get a markdown file, in the right directory (`content/til/hugo-mount-config.md`), with the following in it

```md

```

this is what I have in the archetype file (`archetypes/til.md`)

```md
---
title: "TIL: {{ replace .Name "-" " " | title }}"
date: {{ .Date }}

```

This is a workflow I've become very used to when working with markdown files. Remix treats `.md` & `.mdx` as first class citizens, so I'm using that to power my content in a remix app

# Hugo Mount Config
This is where Hugo mount config comes in. In the Remix app, I created an archetype directory, but I want the output from the cli to be `app/routes`, so this is what my `config.yaml`(used by the Hugo CLI) file looks like

```yaml
module:
  mounts:
    - source: app/routes
      target: content
```

and voila, just like that I can use the hugo cli and the workflow I love, in a react environment. Small win â™¥
