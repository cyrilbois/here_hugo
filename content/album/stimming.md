Cool story about how I found this album.

Rodwell & I used to do DJ practice sessions together (some of my most memorable [B2B sets](https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2020/03/how-to-play-back-to-back-dj-sets/) were with this dude), and the one day he played a track off this album & the sound instantly caught my attention. I remember I kept asking for track after track, & eventually just got the whole album, lol. 

This was a very pivotal time in my curation efforts, as this album & Stimming introduced me to a completely different world of house and techno.

This album is an essential for anyone who enjoys Stimming's sound, and will always be dear to me. Good times:)
