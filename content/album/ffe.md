This album spans across quite a few genres, & was a pleasant listen. I found it on the IDM essentials playlist by spotify, which I'll also embed below.

# IDM Essentials Playlist
I'm not usually a fan of the big editorial playlists by Spotify, but this one has been rereshingly thorough. Lots of good sounds in here, would definitely recommend.

*note: I may be biased, as this playlist has lots of old favourites;)*
