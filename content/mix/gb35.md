# Context
This mix was initially conceptualised with the title ‚Äúmnml techno - SND style‚Äù - as seen in the original Spotify playlist

{{<spotify playlist 18pwPnSCGVfl8xBm0Mvr83>}}

Been listening to SND a few years now, and absolutely fell in love with that sound from first listen, over time, I managed to find a few more artists making similar sound 

Then a few weeks ago, I watched one of Taylor‚Äôs videos, about raster noton, and gave the sound a name, ‚Äúclicks & cuts‚Äù and holy mother of all ships, I found hundreds of hours of music in this genre.

I think I‚Äôm gonna be playing with this sound for years to come üôÇit‚Äôs also idm territory, which is cool
