## An old favourite
Essential, definitely some of the foundational sounds to the drum n bass I love today. It is aging like fine wine.
I remember doing a lot of practice sessions with this album, during my early days of playing the genre, fun times.

Also, such a strong track to open the album with, really sets good tone. The whole album is worth a listen, really.
