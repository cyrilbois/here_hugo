# Curated Albums

## Datassette - Zetex

> this album is perfect. Gonna be listening for many years to come

{{<bandcampalbum 1987056638>}}

I listened to this album at least 10 times, from start to finish. baffles me how I overlooked it when it released last September, considering how big a Datassette fan I am.

While you're here, you might want to check out another Datassette project I really love, a little website called [musicforprogramming.net](https://musicforprogramming.net/)

#### Highlighted tracks
- **Comfort Noise B** - lovely blend of deep & high pitched noises, while maintaining a smooth touch to the track throughout. Nice rhythm too.
- **Let's Move to Belgium** - An ambient take to a song that released just before the album, [Tanz Mit Mir](https://datassette.bandcamp.com/track/tanz-mit-mir). A track that's been on rotation since release! It's fun to get a dance floor & lounge version of a track :)
- **Compound Eyes B** - Glitches done just the way I like 'em. Sounds like a never ending tension build & release
- **Crystal Drool** - Yet another track with pleasant timbre

## Xyla - Ways
Another absolute banger shared by Adrianüôåüèæ

{{<bandcampalbum 1252696711>}}

The opening track, **Shoot**, sets the tone just right. **Feel** confidently continues with the chill note.

Gotta be honest, I didn't think much of the first half of this album until today, when I decided to give it a full playback whilst writing.

Track #4, **Cold**, is where this album captured my attention, the first time I listened to it - the sudden change in energy was intoxicating! The track just before it, **Now**, is full on ambient. Range, contrast, she does it well!

Every track after that manages to make me dance, without fail.

**Narcisuss** opening chords remind me of a popular hip hop beat I've been failing to findüòÖ

# Curated Tracks
Starting with a throwback, alternative pop sounds from Arlo Parks. An artist I always play whenever the lyrics or beats randomly pop into my head.
