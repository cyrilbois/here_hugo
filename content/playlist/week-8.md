## Lordkez
When I come across one Lordkez song, I have to listen to the rest of my favourites by herðŸ˜…can never get enough

I found [Lose Control by Amaria](https://open.spotify.com/track/4fVXcxsXPW5lhy5ut9biHB?si=6b84d1e56f7f4ac8) while in the Lordkez session, fun times :)

## People, places, & things
This is my third time sharing this album on this site, lol. that's how much I've enjoyed it.

Seen [here]({{<ref my-week-in-music-fri-08-april-22>}}), and [Goosebumps mix #29]({{<ref gb29>}})

> Good music is truly timeless, for a 1997 album, this still sounds very fresh. A blend of jazz, earthy techno, & drum'n'bass.
## Plonk by Huerco S.
All Huerco albums have been thoroughly enjoyable, a mixture of Ambient & experimental sounds

## Samiyam
For my hip hop instrumental lovers, if you're into 8-bit influenced sounds, this is for you. As always, I can't think Samiyam without thinking of Jonwayne, they produce sometimes similar sounds, and have a few collaborations too.

These guys make some of the hardest beats in the game, easily.

Appropriate for fans of J Dilla, Flying Lotus

## Tlim shug
While preparing for the Lofi house mix this week, I listened to a lot of Tlim Shug, and that guy never misses! Lots of 4 to the floor lofi bangers (the kind of lofi you can play next to techno, if you're brave enoughðŸ˜‰), and some stuff for the lounge too, man's got range. 

Some dubstep even! [Untitled](https://open.spotify.com/track/0QJ6AaLgU44YnskguHSVFY?si=6450d1b6518045c8) is dope.

[demosdemos](https://tlimshug.bandcamp.com/album/demosdemos) is the release that's got lounge energy, and I love it.

## Art Feynman
Another artist I bumped into whilst preparing for the lofi mix, saved a few albums that I'm really keen to dive into :)

Got a very swing, 19*somethingsomething*, & psychedelic aesthetic to his sound. Will definitely have you dancing

## Heavenchord
Heavenchord has some really good ambient dub techno releases. Sometimes they lean more to the ambient sound, and sometimes more to the dubby side. 

[Sedative #2](https://open.spotify.com/album/5SlLdxzm56DRe0ABywcCiq?si=UPb5RMACQmqGmbSWphJ2IA) goes really well with time for deep focus.

## Versa
Some more dub techno. This time it's deep, dominant sounds. [Temple song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6NPRcKOYbD2rp8AVJr8VPp?si=a39b25db1855473f) sent me on a Versa binge this week!


## Rowena Fysx
Rowena's been in regular rotation since Vusa shared her EP [3rr0r](https://open.spotify.com/album/1cem9I2x2idLH5n3Vz4CNx?si=irQyEEClTeiTBnYA6PExPw). I've had **Apologies** on repeat since repeat, lol.
