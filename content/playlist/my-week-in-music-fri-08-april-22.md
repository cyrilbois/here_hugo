This week Iâ€™ve been an absolute potato in the morning, but I noticed one thing that would consistently bring my energy to the right levels, and bring the day to a start, and that was good music.

## New album from Max Cooper
He teased this one on his socials for a while, haha. One or two music videos dropped prior to album release, & the one video introduced me to someone that does generative art.
As always with Max, I enjoy majority of this album.

## Lofi Sounds from Tlim Shug
Probably my favourite find this week, a gorgeous & intimate sounding EP from Tlim, with a Lofi house aesthetic. I like every single track on this

## Curated by Ralf Gum
I found this track in a mix by Ralf Gum, and just had to get it then. Lovely beat.

## Some tunes from Adrian
Man I could make a completely separate post just to cover the music Adrian has shared with me in the last few months. This week, I listened to the album People, Places, & things. Love the drumming in this.

Good music is truly timeless, for a 1997 album, this still sounds very fresh.

## Telefone Tel Aviv
After listening to the the Telefone Tel Aviv version of Stimming's Judith Maria, I went on to binge more of the remixer's tracks, and I was not disappointed.
