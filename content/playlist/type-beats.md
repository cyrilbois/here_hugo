# Words & Curation by Rodwell

> I have gotten in to a habit of listening to "type" beats, which are songs made by producers to mimick popular artists type of songs in order to get fan attraction and also to sell their beats to up coming or established artists.
>
> I got into them with a friend, we like making up out own freestlye on the fly raps to any song as long as the beat is fire.
> 
> So they are mostly hip hop/trap/rnb songs
>
> first batch composes of some slow bass led songs that I like playing when I am feeling down...
