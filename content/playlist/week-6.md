# Artists
### Move D
Really been enjoying listening to this dude. Check out his stuff [here]({{<ref move-d>}}).

He also features in [Goosebumps mix #32]({{<ref gb32>}})

### Puma Blue @worldwide.fm
I really like what Puma Blue is doing over at [Worldwide FM](https://worldwidefm.net/episode/blueish-puma-blue). I like the format of "Imma just hang out & play you some music I like"


## Trying out biweekly mix uploads
I want to try stick to releasing mixes every other Sunday, at the very least. This week, I recorded [goosebumps mix #32]({{<ref gb32>}}).

# Dub Monitor Interview 01
Always a good Sunday when Taylor uploads. This interview was packed with wisdom. Looking forward to going through Uun's music. Also, the way he describes the kind of dreams he experiences, literally my life. Was weird to hear someone else express it, but also really cool to hear it put to words

# Ronny Pries talk - What makes a great DJ
A must watch for any DJ. Love the values shared in this.

## Discover quickly playlist from a few weeks ago
I use [discover quickly](https://discoverquickly.com/) to help with curating efforts. (here are [other 3rd party Spotify tools I use]({{<ref spotify-tools>}})).

Anyway, back to the point, I had a playlist in there that I hadn't exported to Spotify yet, did so yesterday, and I quite liked it.

# Albums I Enjoyed
## John Tejada - Sleepwalker
![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2881945753_10.jpg)
John Tejada's latest release [Sleepwalker](https://johntejada.bandcamp.com/album/sleepwalker) was fun to listen to.

## Ways by Xyla
![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0138336818_10.jpg)
Adrian always shares dope shit, he recently put me on [Ways by Xyla](https://xylasf.bandcamp.com/album/ways). Love the drums in that album. Future classic for me
>  Echoes of sweaty rave anthems and classic IDM head trips can be heard strewn throughout Waysâ€™ serpentine compositions, awash in deep ambient swirls and intriguingly twisted samples.

# Highlighted track(s)
## [Muslimgauze - The gulf between us](https://boomkat.com/products/gulf-between-us-f0cb3743-6c16-49d8-871c-ac3e797577f0)
{{<spotify track 62Sg0uHQIx1fFSs1d9fwZB>}}
[1997 release](https://boomkat.com/products/gulf-between-us-f0cb3743-6c16-49d8-871c-ac3e797577f0) that still sounds no more than a day old. Nice blend of dub and tribal elements. I found it in [this playlist that Ronny shared](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0NluoTf4azl4CtBhAErU2r?si=1f21e46b54b64e76)
