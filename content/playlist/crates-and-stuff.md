# A Muted Radiance. by Altstadt Echo
{{<youtube iAR661mNjiA>}}
Altstadt Echo is the host of [Dub Monitor](https://www.youtube.com/c/DubMonitor), & he's a remarkable curator.

A Muted Radiance is a 3 track EP that couldn't have had better timing. I've been exploring the intersection between drum&bass and dub techno. That intersection usually lands you in IDM territory, & there's some good stuff brewing in there.

## A lovely blend of garage/techno/dubstep
The kind of stuff that [Burial](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0uCCBpmg6MrPb1KY2msceF?si=XniP13CdTiOqWrkA-qcztg) is made of:)
