tldr: I struggled with giving this post/playlist a title, jeez man. If you like a sound, I strongly recommend you listen to the full project.

### some notable finds this week

{{<spotifyembed playlist 36249aZuD0xMN4bg3fMQt7>}}

- ZURE is an awesome ambient track, sounds like the start of a dystopian movie.
- [System](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5YX8aqhP93gcj7kmjOXmSm?si=CUrVoR1GRXWUMffUANLx8g) is one of those groups I've beeen wanting to do a deep dive on, haven't been disappointed so far. "Dub-inspired experimental project of 3 Danish electronic musicians."
- that [Bowery Electric](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6a27jEzxHDgONdmADAGcej?si=dT7SqF8tQ_Cp0SCzYaYVPQ) album is so so good. played it twice, back to back, the day it was shared with me.
- Acid Dub StudiesðŸ™Œ
- would highly recommend a deep dive of [Samiyam](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56j1OkSq0AMCgZGKVNc8GP?si=c4-kDezlQgKdkbDhPchACA)

Was such a pleasure listening to new tunes from Patricia, Datassette, Holy Other, Clams Casino, and more, all in the same week. what an honor.

Datassette's music is so well masteredðŸ™Œ
- **Datassette - Gong Zahlensender**: listen to that warm but dominant ping pong, coming from the rear left of your speakers/headphones
