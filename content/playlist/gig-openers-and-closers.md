- opening gigs is probably my favourite slot, nothing like taking your time to slowly warm up a crowd to some magical times.
- closing is a pretty sweet spot too, similar nature, bringing people in
- what they have in common is that they're usually the longest spots, meaning you aren't rushed to play banger after banger. this is the time you can really share a well curated set of tunes. it's especially nice if you're aware of the crowd you're expecting beforehand, allows you to research what works.
