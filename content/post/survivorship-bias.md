Most entrepreneurs—if not all—don’t know what they’re doing. They don’t have a meticulous step-by-step plan to follow. Yet, we tend to try to emulate the “recipe” used by the few ones that achieved success.

And, because of the survivorship bias and our love for good stories, we tend to believe them.
