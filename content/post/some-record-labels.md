## Deep House

* Stay true sounds
* Just move records
* All Day I Dream: I remember bingeing their releases for quite a while, fun times. I still enjoy the nostalgic feeling some of their releases still give me. Their sound head heavy influence on the direction of the [Portable Sunsets]({{<ref portable-sunsets>}}) playlist.
* Oh So Coy & Rogue Decibels

## Drum n Bass

* Hospital Records: this label is the one that really cemented my love for the genre. Tony's podcast was very influencial to the sounds I listen to now.
* [Med School Music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4eghc7Gvxuwi6XzTr4a5Ev?si=eb3bb754d5744d5c): Can't talk about Hospital Records & leave out the sister label, Med School. A lot of my liquid & neurofunk favourites were discovered here
* Microfunk: A label I discovered through Hospital Records, as they're the one's who introduced me to Bop.

## Mixed bag

* [Warp records](https://warp.net/us)
* Hypnus
* Ostgut Ton
* Ilian Tape
* hyperdub
* Livity sounds
* Astral Industries - I especially like the artwork
