An answer [Jason](https://www.jason.af/)'s question "What did you learn in 2022?"

# Product

- I'm 6 months into working for a [product company](https://flexperto.com), the longest I've spent doing daily work on a single product
- Software architecture & refactoring works are ongoing. There's never really a start or stop date
- [Let your customers outgrow you](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ssgPA6XL5IqeWmaUGVky5?si=dq2cxqImQt-8iU3ScFfo1A)

### Product Books

- [Spotify Teardown]({{<ref spotify-teardown>}})

# [Devops]({{<ref "/tags/devops">}})

- [MTTR > MTBF]({{<ref mttr>}}) -  Optimising Mean Time To Recovery is more important than trying to minimise Mean Time Between Failures.

# [Linux]({{<ref "/tags/linux">}})

- Wrote my first [bash script]({{<ref bash-automation>}})!

# [Architecture]({{<ref "/tags/architecture">}})

- [DDD]({{<ref "/book/ddd">}})
- [Various AWS bits]({{<ref "/resource/aws">}}), preparing for Solutions Architecture exam

# Organisation Design

It seems this topic is pretty closely related to software architecture.

- [Reckoning with Conway's Law]({{<ref conways-law>}}) - thoughtworks podcast featuring James Lewis & Martin Fowler
- Other Dan North & James Lewis stuff
- [ING bank]({{<ref ing-bank>}}) - A Case study of ING bank and their experiments with team topologies.
- [Patterns of effective teams]({{<ref Patterns-of-Effective-Teams>}}) - A talk by Dan North about ways you can organise your teams for success.

### Organisation Design Books

- [Team topologies]({{<ref team-topologies>}})
- [Accelerate]({{<ref accelerate>}}) - referenced heavily in the conference circle, podcasts, articles, other books. This book is a must read
- [Working Backwards](https://www.workingbackwards.com/) - Current read

# Cognitive Load

A topic related to organisation design & architecture. Learning about [cognitive load theory]({{<ref cognitive-load-theory>}}) was pretty insightful, applicable to many areas of life.

This idea was introduced to me by [James Lewis]({{<ref tt-jl.md>}}) while discussing his experience & research on Team Topologies, software architecture, & complexity science.

# [UX]({{<ref "/tags/ux">}})

User Experience continues to be a topic of interest. 2022 observations focused on the UX music apps mostly.

I wrote about [dark patterns]({{<ref dark-patterns>}})

## Some stuff I read

- [Designing Effective UX for Human Eyes](https://uxmag.com/articles/designing-effective-ux-for-human-eyes-banner)
- [Accidental Dismissal of Overlays: A Common Mobile Usability Problem](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accidental-overlay-dismissal/)
- [Ethics, UX and our role in all this](https://uxdesign.cc/ethics-ux-and-our-role-in-all-this-60617e4bd962)

# Leadership

- [Engineering Management for the rest of us]({{<ref engineering-management>}}) - this book was a lovely read
- [Managing client relationships]({{<ref client-relationships>}}) (as a consultant)

# Productivity

- [Saying no, increased focus](https://fs.blog/focus-to-win/), reduced involvement in multiple projects in fly at once.
- [Applying shape up]({{<ref applying-shape-up>}})
