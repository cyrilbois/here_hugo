tldr: evolving the way I capture my ideas, with the goal of simplifying it further.

- evolving from this ['old']({{<ref the-way-my-notes-are-setup>}}) setup.

## main editor

- VS Code: for the terminal so I can use [hugo archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) to quickly create new files, + to handle version control.
- ~~Obsidian: where I'm trying to do most of my writing~~ the lack of a good mobile writing experience resulted in me using this less & less, to the point where I don't even use it on the computers anymore. What I loved about obsidian, is I got to capture my notes in markdown, so transfering to another app/platform, like this [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site, is made easy.

## This site

- powered by static site generator, [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- all the notes are written in markdown. A decent bunch of them were brought in from mu obsidian notes.
  - fun fact, the first iteration of this site was done using obsidian publish, which is also a great platform when in the right context.

## mobile & quick capture

- Apple notes: allows for natively captured & shared notes on phone & laptop. little bit of vendor lock in, but that's okay for the quick capture stuff.
  - this is also where I keep journal & personal notes.
  - this is also where the first draft notes for this site exist. when I'm ready to expand on a note, I quickly create a markdown file using [hugo archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/), and copy paste. This process also ensures I look at a note twice before first publish. allows me to catch some silly mistakes sometimes, haha.
- ~~Obsidian mobile~~

## sync

- iCloud
- Git (ultimately for publishing [guidefari.com](https://guidefari.com))
- ~~Obsidian Sync (so I can have the website's `md` files on mobile too)~~
