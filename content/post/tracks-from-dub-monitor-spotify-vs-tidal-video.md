# the video

# Echospace - The Coldest Season
{{<spotifyembed album 6inU6drg77x3bgkN2OpDq6>}}

# Plastikman, Richie Hawtin - Consumed
first listen, opening track sounds strong. calm, long running, & deep pulse.
{{<spotifyembed album 1U7aY4kI9xeMuI3nD4LKBy>}}

# Robert Hood - Internal Empire
quickly sampled a few tracks, sounds glitchy, & fast, slightly hardcore too. definitely worth a full listen, maybe while working out.
{{<spotifyembed album 1cxnfaTwhRSEVJaEYIrFJc>}}

# Sandwell District - Feed Forward
a classic, in my eyes. my favourites include **Immolare**, **SVAR - Graz Version**, **Immolare - Studio**, and of course **Grey Cut Out**. the sound engineering in Sandwell District's work is incredible.
{{<spotifyembed album 7qE9k9dvJP4q4rnVlCZStd>}}

# Efdemin - Decay
**Subatomic** sounds nice, definitely giving the full album a listen. sounds suitable to play during work hours too.
{{<spotifyembed album 7tjUFmdXzjzAFzs10mGGvL>}}

# Mathimidori - Akebono
~~not the most solid first impression~~(quickly changed when I sampled two more tracks), but can be sampled in full when working. very dub technoey, **Shao** sounds cool for sure. opening track has a nice thud to it.

{{<spotifyembed album 2GisvCwVDI4cUekPU1gkqX>}}

# Skee Mask - Compro
[`Album`, `dnb`]

another classic in my eyesüòçI'm pretty sure [BOP](https://open.spotify.com/artist/02ZCVD3nqfqNId8lvpvCBb?si=FkJTJNt-QkWHzKd2uHCW2g) introduced me to Skee Mask
{{<spotifyembed album 3yXIkSJWpudtgF0TZuB16U>}}

# Umfang - OK
[`Album`, `lofi-influences`]

**six** sounds thumpy & club ready
{{<spotifyembed album 11lyNolKZpzdBtmzo54D0d>}}

# Headless Horsemen - Inhabited Shadows
[`Album`, `dark`]

has some witch-house like sounds, and some dnb too? sounds trippy though, I'd definitely recommend a 100% sober mind when sampling thisü§£
* I actually might find more dnb friendly tracks here..
* **Dream Denier** ü§Øappropriate for a workout playlist
{{<spotifyembed album 4s54EXMsJrZFyjBLayJpE0>}}

# The Tuss - Rushup Edge

The man, the [myth](https://www.discogs.com/artist/798219-The-Tuss), the [legend](https://www.discogs.com/artist/45-Aphex-Twin)
{{<youtube R-5koLtMy98>}}

**Earth Like Conditions** sounds like another solid intro track. might be a well rounded techno album.
{{<spotifyembed album 7hw0H4laJwxOdnHQtITQ9X >}}

# Xhin - Sword
`Album`

**Foreshadowed** üôåsome tracks don't even need a second listen for me to hit the like button. kinda reminds me of [ASC](https://open.spotify.com/artist/23ofL7vJakLiALOWk9M3RO?si=VGBeG3U8RFWlb0Tkv5olZQ).
