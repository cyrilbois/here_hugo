notes & reflections from a podcast episode by [Kyle Prinsloo](https://twitter.com/study_web_dev). 
these notes & questions are geared around frontend work.

## who is your ideal client?
this one is a must, a lot of people I've engaged with for freelance gigs normally won't have established this before reaching out to me.

## what is the desired action?
this one may seem basic but I sometimes forget to ask it early on. establish the call to action for a site user.

## what makes you unique?
this is important, as anything that makes you unique has to be communicated in one way or another on the site, "presented in a way that helps the client/business stand out". some businesses are doing nothing unique, good to keep in mind.

## what is an average client/customer worth to your business?
one I've never asked, but it helps when it comes time to do *value based pricing* - which I am yet to try.
knowing what the average customer/client is worth also helps with marketing budget, so you know the maximum that can be spent to acquire a new customer.

*tangent* - the options for pricing can be summed up as:
1. hourly
2. fixed price
3. value based pricing

## how many clients do you usually get each month?
this is a continuation on the question above, really. 
also helps to know what products/services that most of their clients are going for. again, helps with marketing/design of the website.

## how do you currently get new customers?
helps you identify what you can improve on, when it comes to the marketing.

## do you have professional images & a brand guideline
- professional images is a must for product based businesses.

# when would you like the project completed?
- the more urgent it is, the more valuable it is to the client, so, bill accordingly.

### bonus
if you feel a client may not be able to afford your rates, based off of your spidey senses, ask "do you have a budget set aside for this, of minimum X"
X being the minimum you'd be willing to charge in order to engage.
