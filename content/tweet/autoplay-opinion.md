## I like being given a moment to breathe
And to appreciate the end of a body of work. Especially with music, it's nice to get that moment of silence at the end of a playlist, album, or custom queue. Rest your ears for a sec, catch up to my surroundings, and sometimes reflect on what I've just listened to.

Most times, I listen to music when I'm working, and when that silence comes, I've caught myself letting it ride for 30 minutes to a few hours.
