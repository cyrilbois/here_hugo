- Riyoon just came out with a remix of [Ektoplast](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6tNkFg99kBDU3pmj7aNe0O?si=Q7WHkEJBRD-5fI5V8sfrng)'s [Vision](https://talparec.bandcamp.com/album/ether), and it's a gorgeous tune. A teaser of upcoming [Ether (Remixes)](https://talparec.bandcamp.com/album/ether-remixes) - which also includes a remix from Landhouse. Excited to spend more time going through Ekoplast's discography.
- The other tracks in the playlist are timeless Riyoon favourites:)
