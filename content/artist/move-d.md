# Move D @ The Lot Radio
{{<youtube 9Tn9Mh42heY>}}

I love the opening of this mix, so well done. He builds tension in the first 20 minutes, by calmly bringing you to quite a heavy dance, then instantly changes the mood to a lounge like sound, and it fits in perfectly.

That moment of instant switch gives you space to appreciate what just happened, and to anticipate what’s coming next. Very confident energy control 🙌🏾

[Contrast]({{<ref good-dub-techno-mix>}}) is a powerful tool in DJing, when done right of course.

### Check out Fred P as well
I recently started listening to him, thanks to Dub Monitor. This channel is legit one of my favourite corners on the internet
