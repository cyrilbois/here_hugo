## Zulzi (Software Engineer - )
- Embedded in the [Checkers Sixty60](https://www.sixty60.co.za/) project

- This project has been a great case study for how socio-technical challenges can impact a productðŸ˜…
- Still taking any excuse to write: Architecture, Engineering strategy, documenting patterns

## Writing

## Goosebumps

## Flexperto (Frontend Engineer - )
- Long term project was to convert a monolith php web app into React, all while keeping production up.
- Built, battle tested, & documented migration strategies.
- Documented patterns around our micro-frontend applications.
- It being an old codebase, refactoring was a big part of my day to day.
- Wearing other hats besides frontend. I some backend work (MolecularJS & PHP), & build tooling improvements.
- My knowledge of Linux, docker, bare metal, & cloud environments improved immensely as a result of working here.
- I saw positive side effects from my writing efforts.

## Sigma (Frontend Engineer - )
- Bespoke software consultancy of about 20-30 employees.
- Worked across multiple teams, and different technology stacks, including VB.Net, Angular, and React.
- My time at sigma allowed me to demonstrate the ability to quickly adapt to the changing environments, & thrive within them.
- Embedded in a Hungerrush team with the task of updating the UI of a VB.Net application to match their 2021 Design System, based on Material UI.
- My Angular experience was in the same Hungerrush team, after I finished with the assignment above.
- Built a re-usable React component library for Quorum.
- Spent my last few months embedded in the internal Sigma Digital team. Using NextJS.
- The most interesting assignment was building proof of concept projects, as part of architecture research.
