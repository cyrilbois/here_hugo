## Understanding the problem space
- I think having a good understanding of your problem space results in higher quality software.

## Communication between dev & business is simplified
- There's less layers of translation. less likeihood of broken telephone happening.
> [DDD enables developers, domain experts and business people to communicate effectively using a single, unified language.](https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load)

## Bounded Context
- A simple word such as "Booking" can mean different things in different contexts

## Actionable items
- Name your functions/methods in a way that represents the domain event
- Use your types to encapsulate the domain
  - Actions
  - Events
  - Models
