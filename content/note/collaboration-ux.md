Basically asked me what features would make collaboration on a music streaming app an overall better experience for me.

This is my attempt at basic UX research, trying to identify the problems worth solving.

# Soundcloud comments
- I like the core UX of soundcloud comments on a track. 
- The comments are time stamped
- Can do commentary as you listen to a track or a mix etc. Svenio once asked for feedback on [a mix of his](https://soundcloud.com/seven74/house-is-house-001), and I easily made time-stamped comments.
- This can also provide listening prompts (for active listening sessions)

# Shared Ownership of playlists
- Spotify is a good example of this, and the only one I've used somewhat extensively
- Please share any other apps that support this :)
- It's easy to identify who added a track to a playlist, because avatar & name

The mobile experience is also gets the job done well

- To be able to comment on playlists would be nice

# Messaging within the platform
* A way to share playlists and stuff within the platform, in a DM or group like setting.
* Makes for contextual conversations
* Again, soundcloud is a good example of this. The music player is also embedded in the chat, meaning you can play from directly in there
* Only a desktop experience though. **Mobile is essential** for this sort of thing, it's important to be able to collaborate on the go.
