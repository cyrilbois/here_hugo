Brian Holt: [I have shifted my thinking a little bit to chase the minimum lovable product. Some minimum viable products can cut out the parts that make them special in the chase of shipping faster and I think this can frequently be a mistake.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/product/product-specs)

- [Ibra](https://ibrathesheriff.com) also mentioned this - chasing quality over quick & frequent releases
