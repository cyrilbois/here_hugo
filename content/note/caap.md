The end goal is pretty simple, to increase motivation by nurturing a codebase that invites you to work in it.

It can be an energy sap to work in a codebase that's got lots of [cracked windows](/cracked-window) & [friction](/cognitive-load-theory) to getting work done.

The more points I wrote down, the more this felt like yet another [dx](/dx) chat. lol.

# User-Centric design

[Borrowing from Tony Ho Tran](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/user-centered-design-definition-examples-and-tips/), User Centric design can be summarised as:

1. Identify the users’ needs and the context around them.
2. Specify requirements for both the business and user.
3. Design solutions

The same philosophy can be applied to your codebase.

# Iterative improvement

- Regular, little refactorings, see [tidy, first?](/tidy-first)
- Iteratively based on user feedback
- Iterating based on improved mental models of the problem & solution

# Feedback loops from users

Regularly interview, poll, & survey your developers in order to find pain points & desired features in their development workflow. Make sure to actually action out stuff based off the feedback if you don’t want to see engagement fizzle.

# Documentation

- Architecture
- How to fix common issues

# Onboarding

In an ideal world, products have a well thought out and streamlined onboarding process.
You want the same experience for your codebase.

My new gold standard for a good dev onboarding process
is a new dev should be able to make their first productive commit or pull request on day one.

# Analytics & metrics

There's no shortage of analytics & metric frameworks for SaaS products.
I'd say you can do the same for your codebase health.
