- Regionally resilient. Replicated across all AZs. Can also replicate between regions
- Object size goes from 0 bytes to 5TB
- Bucket ID has to be globally unique, across all AWS accounts, & all regions.
- Flat structure. **koala.jpg** is in the same *folder* as **/old/koala.jpg**. the **/old/** is just a prefix
- Buckets - 100 soft limit, 1000 hard limit per account
- has different access tiers
- Encryption in transit, achieved via SSL/TLS

## Bucket Policies

- S3 buckets are **private by default**, ie only accessible by root account user.
  - S3 bucket policy is a form of resource policy. It controls who can access S3
  - unlimited objects in a bucket
- a bucket, & objects inside a bucket are not the same thing
  - `arn:aws:s3:::memes` - bucket
  - `arn:aws:s3:::memes/*` - objects in bucket

- [ ] on bucket policy, what is the **principal** key responsible for?

# Using S3 to host DJ mixes for [Goosebumps](https://goosebumps.fm)

- create bucket
- edit bucket access policies
- IAM account for goosebumps app
- next api route (takes in a key as param, that's item name or ID), and that route is what returns an audio stream
- cloudfront + S3?
- `npm install --save @aws-sdk/client-s3`
- Amazon MediaConvert to make it streamable? or are the *small* file sizes negligible? 70MB to 350MB - this is probably overkill. S3 + cloudfront ought to be enough
