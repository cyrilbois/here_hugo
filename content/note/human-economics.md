This has come up in enough conversations that I thought I should write it down.

A few weeks ago, my bro said to me
> If you can’t make an economic case for an engineering decision/initiative, you might wanna leave it alone.

And while I agree, consideration should also be given to the opposing perspective.

## Don’t neglect the human side

And I've found that time and time again, after catering to those human needs by tackling a [**low hanging fruit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCP1ZzpTvPA), I'd have built enough momentum and a rush to pick up more challenging work.

Feels like the same mental trick as a pomodoro.
