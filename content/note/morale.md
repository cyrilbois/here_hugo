- I’ve routinely seen team morale at its highest when everyone is focused on the same goal. One task, one feature
- For an extended period of time
- Extended period of time allows people to learn each others’ rhythms. That’s not something you can speed run unless you have very self aware, or very experienced people who can also communicate well
- The shared context makes for reduced overheads of coordination & communication cross teams
- This also goes hand in hand with autonomy. It drives autonomy and ownership, but it needs you to be trusted with autonomy in the first place, before you can start reaping those benefits
- Having a shared problem & collaborating your way to a solution can also strengthen your relationships with the collaborators. “Something something trauma bond” 😂.

## But if we give teams too much autonomy, there’ll be too much variance in our codebases

- A way to mitigate this is to have those responsible for architecture & platform to define what the constraints are
- Ie: which areas can we innovate on, and which areas are standardised
