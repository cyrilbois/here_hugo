### Its limitations

- From the original blog post about Spotify Model “this article is only a snapshot of our current way of working - a journey in progress, not a journey completed. By the time you read this, things have already changed” - Kniberg & Ivarsson
- no heuristics for Conway’s law
- no patterns for team interactions
- no triggers for change and evolution

### its strengths

- Encourages flow of change, as each team has all the capabilities it needs to deliver value
- establishes and clarifies team responsibilities. no ambiguity in who owns what
- promotes good kind of collaboration between teams
- plans and budgets for cross-team enablers - think guilds; bringing people together from all over the organisation
