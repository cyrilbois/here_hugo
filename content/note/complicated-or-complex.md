## Context
- Once again trying to differentiate between complicated & complex problems.
- This note highlights more questions you can ask yourself when you're trying to diagnose what kind of problem you have in front of you.
- Organisations can be looked at as complex systems
- Software projects & engineering teams can also be viewed as complex systems

# Properties to help with classification of problems

1. Nature of components:
   - Complicated problems involve many parts, but these parts are typically fixed and have predictable interactions.
   - Complex problems have components that can adapt, evolve, and change their behavior based on interactions.

2. Predictability:
   - Complicated problems, while difficult, are generally predictable if you understand all the components.
   - Complex problems are inherently unpredictable due to [emergent behaviors](/emergent-behaviours) and non-linear interactions.

3. Solvability:
   - Complicated problems can often be solved with enough expertise, resources, and time.
   - Complex problems may not have a single "correct" solution and often require ongoing management rather than one-time fixes.

4. Cause and effect:
   - In complicated problems, cause and effect relationships are generally clear and can be mapped.
   - Complex problems often exhibit unclear or delayed cause-effect relationships, making it difficult to pinpoint direct causality.

5. Replicability:
   - Solutions to complicated problems can usually be replicated with similar results in different contexts.
   - Solutions to complex problems are often context-specific and may not work the same way in different environments.

6. Approach to understanding:
   - Complicated problems can be understood by breaking them down into smaller parts (reductionist approach).
   - Complex problems require a holistic approach, considering the system as a whole and the [interactions between parts](/team-topologies#team-interaction-modes).

7. Time dimension:
   - Complicated problems are often static or change in predictable ways over time.
   - Complex problems are dynamic, with the system and its components evolving over time.

8. Expertise required:
   - Complicated problems typically require deep expertise in specific domains.
   - Complex problems often require interdisciplinary knowledge and the ability to synthesize insights from multiple fields.
