# Context

Consider this a continuation of [writing retro for Q1](/2024-q1-writing). [Writing strategy for 2024](/2024-writing) will also be an interesting read.

For months (approaching 12 at this point), I've been living under the pressure of "I'm not writing as much as I want to".
I recently interrogated this feeling, which I felt wasn't serving me anymore (if ever).

I figured if I can answer the question "What's the goal behind my writing anyway?", then I can come up with metrics to measure what "writing enough" looks like.

Because this whole time I've just been operating on feelings, "ooo yeah I've done a decent amount of writing these last two weeks", "this week's been quiet, I don't like that". There hasn't been an actual measure

# Audience of one

There’s something to be said about the practicality of this

- Andy Matuschak has a [note](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J) about this
- Tiago Forte always says "Capture what resonates"

# Retro on: Weekly LinkedIn post

This is a retro from my journal. I don't usually post these, but this is related and valuable to note in a shared space.

I woke up once and decided "it'd be nice to share something from my site on the very professional networking site, Linkedin."
*What happens next will shock you*

- Lost steam after a 3 or 4 week streak
- Maybe the fact that I had no content plan ahead of time contributed to stopping. I just write what resonates, when it pops up.
- And this initiative wasn’t really attached to any specific goal, or one that had been explicitly stated.
- I did start conversations with a few new people though, RE my writing. That's always fun
  - None related to the posting though, one from twitter, one from google?
  - In hindsight, this streak may have contributed to a few inbound leads.
- Hate it or love it, this remains a useful tool for 'increasing your luck surface area'
