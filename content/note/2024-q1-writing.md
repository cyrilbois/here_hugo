## Overall: Messy process
The process has been a little messy for a while,
mostly because using multiple note taking apps. 
- Notion
- 3 markdown repos in VSC*ode, goosebumps, this blog,
and the notes repo from work.
- Bear for markdown on Apple devices. Very lovely sync
- Apple notes for all sorts
- At some point, obsidian too because the homies peer pressured meðŸ˜‚
- This is being written in Github mobile. I'm not at home
 
## Simplified & Current workflow
the workflow at the moment might stick. 

For stuff that I know Iâ€™m happy having public, I go straight to writing markdown files in the repo.
This is to reduce the number of steps it takes to go from thought to publish. 
## Helper scripts

- I also use scripts to generate new files with all the frontmatter.
  - this is easy to do with [hugo archetypes](), and [bash scripts]().

## Quick Capture
Apple notes is mostly for journaling, meeting notes, and handwritten notes.
itâ€™s what I use as my brain dump, or when I donâ€™t have a laptop next to me but need to **quickly capture** a thought. 

## Obsidian experiments  
Iâ€™ve been experimenting with bring it back into my workflow though (the messy bits I mentioned.)
