## context
Here are all the atomic notes that eventually came out of this:
- [Talk by Dan North on Flow](/dn-flow). introduces value stream mapping, and shows how to do it.
- [On WIP Limits](/wip-limits)
  - Book notes - [Implementing Lean](/lean). So far, talks about queuing theory, and value stream mapping
- [The impact of having slack in your dev cycles](/slack)

> [successful teams are organised around flow. Flow of information, flow of requirements, flow of value from concept to customer. You want to design your information structures in a way that facilitates the flow of information & value](/tt-jl)- **James Lewis**

## First Draft
*LOL at how old this note is, I've been thinking of how to package this for 4 months+ now!
I've decided to leave the first draft as is.*

- James Lewis
- Dan North's description of lead time
- Paul's insights on PR's. They're the closest thing to value, how that ties into lead time
  - leave all your work to push teammates PRs. how they’re more valuable than WIP
- How limiting WIP feeds into this
  - John Cutler has some opinions on this
  - Less context switching
- Accelerate also has some highlights on the topic
- Timm Stelzer - ultimately, we sell acceptance criteria
