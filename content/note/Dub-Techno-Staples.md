There’s a reason why people always mention Deepchord, Fluxion etc when we talk about dub techno. These have become **staple names** in the genre, and for good reason, in my opinion.

## Deepchord - Wind in trees
The song that made me think of writing this post in the first place

## Fluxion - Parallel Moves
Listeing to this album for the first time, while publishing this note.

### Dub monitor - A Brief Tour of Ambient Dub Techno

I couldn't agree more. My point is there's a reason why these artists get so much of that respect.

Awesome video with weeks' worth of music shared, do give it a look if you love this sound ✌
