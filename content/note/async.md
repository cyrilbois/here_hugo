![If you're reading this I'm working async](https://res.cloudinary.com/hokaspokas/image/upload/v1678788842/here-hugo/SCR-20230314-gpt_mikbhh.png)

* I prefer to work async by default, sync only when necessary - such as pair programming, debugging, brainstorm sessions, helping unblock someone
* this may sometimes mean my work hours are not the same as yours, so please don’t feel pressured to respond to my queries outside of your work hours.
* True insight comes when I'm not in a sync environment. This means I often take notes while walking, gyming, shower, and many other places outside of the usual work environment. It's easier to connect and put thoughts together after letting things ponder for a bit.
* Async by default creates artifacts (written documents, diagrams, and other illustrative stuff) that others can refer to in the future, preserving institutional knowledge & context beyond one or a few people's heads

# What is working async

- 30-60 minute [pomodoro sessions](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique)
  - Sometimes much longer
- Slack closed, opened at an hourly interval
  - This is why I won't be responding immediately

# Why do I do it

- Optimising for deep work
- Minimising cost associated with context switching
- I function more effectively with mono-tasking & immersion in the task at hand
