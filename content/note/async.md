![If you're reading this I'm working async](https://res.cloudinary.com/hokaspokas/image/upload/v1678788842/here-hugo/SCR-20230314-gpt_mikbhh.png)

# What is working async

- 30-60 minute [pomodoro sessions](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique)
  - Sometimes much longer
- Slack closed, opened at an hourly interval
  - This is why I won't be responding immediately

# Why do I do it

- Optimising for deep work
- Minimising cost associated with context switching
- I function more effectively with mono-tasking & immersion in the task at hand
