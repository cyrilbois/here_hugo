![If you're reading this I'm working async](https://res.cloudinary.com/hokaspokas/image/upload/v1678788842/here-hugo/SCR-20230314-gpt_mikbhh.png)

# What is working async

- 60 - 90 minute [pomodoro sessions](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). Sometimes much longer
- 20 - 30 minute rest
- Repeat
- Slack closed, opened at the end of each pomodoro.

# Why do I do it

- Optimising for deep work. Async allows me to immerse myself in work
- Minimising cost associated with context switching
- I function more effectively with mono-tasking & immersion in the task at hand

- True insight comes when I'm not in a sync environment. This means I often take notes while walking, gyming, shower, and many other places outside of the usual work environment. It's easier to connect and put thoughts together after letting things ponder for a bit.

- Async by default creates artifacts (written documents, diagrams, and other illustrative stuff) that others can refer to in the future, preserving institutional knowledge & context beyond one or a few people's heads

## Caveats

- Though I prefer to work async by default, there's many a time when sync is the best way to get things done:
  - pair programming,
  - debugging,
  - brainstorm sessions,
  - helping unblock someone

- If we're sharing a backlog, it's very likely that I'll be sync with you even during my 'async' hours,
 just part of collaboration, rightðŸ˜‰
- this may sometimes mean my work hours are not the same as yours, so please donâ€™t feel pressured to respond to my queries outside of your work hours.
