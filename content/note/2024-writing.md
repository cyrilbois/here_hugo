# 2023 retro
- A call with Ibra made me realise I didn't spend as much time writing as I'd have liked.
  - This was based off 2 weeks of data though, so it may not be completely accurate.
- Recurring themes:
  - [Socio-technical challenges](/tags/process)
  - Complexity
  - Product
- Big topics I didn't have time to explore, and felt a lot of guilt about:
  - [DX](/tags/dx)
  - [DDD](/tags/ddd)
  - The idea with these was to dig out **actionable insights** around the topics.
- **Bias towards actionability**: This was a big mood for 2023
- [Writers who operate](https://lethain.com/writers-who-operate/) by Will Larson sums up a bit of the magic I've got going on here. recommended read for sure.
- My note taking after watching videos, & listening to podcasts could improve. My current process is to do the first watch without taking notes, unless there's info needed immediately. then the content will sit in my "watched/listened" list until I'm writing on the topic. that's when a second listen and note taking happens
  - I feel like lots of solid material slips through the cracks this way though
  - Non-text content is hard to index & 'bump' into, which limits the serendipity surface areaðŸ˜…

### Playbooks
- The idea of [playbooks](/tags/playbook) was pitched to me by Ibra. The intention is to take a topic/problem, and share actionable steps to address the pains.
- Taking the form of prompts, resources, heuristics, suggested steps, things I've seen work for others. Basically anything I think could be helpful
- It's not necessarily things I know will work
- I like addressing topics I find to be recurring in retros across the teams I've worked in.
- Reminds me a lot of [Brie](https://koolaidfactory.com/) & [Julia Evan's](https://wizardzines.com/) zines.
- Another good example is [Domain Driven Refactorings](https://hschwentner.io/domain-driven-refactorings/). I'm yet to dive into this site, I found it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPcIvYrEkv8&t=2177s).

### Tools
- Readwise reader's highlights are a great place to use for sourcing.
I just search for topics/keywords and get all the webpages & books I've highlighted around the topic.
- I use too many apps for note taking. Apple for handwritten and personal notes, Notion for stuff I may want to share with a semi-private audience, Bear for first drafts and notes I can share while screencasting at work.
  - Bear captures writing for this site, goosebumps, and work notes
- lol, recently added Linear to manage Goosebumps features & roadmap, this blog too

# 2024
- I don't like planning my writing too much. [Ultimately, I'm the first audience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9),
meaning I'm naturally inclined to write about what I'm learning about, or interested in at the time.
- Address the big topics as [atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNUaiGAXp21eorsER1Jm9yU) notes as JIT.
  - They can be packaged after the fact, either into playbooks, or series of posts
- I remain undecided on ideal cadence & 'volume'
  - I feel like aiming for 30 minutes, 5 days a week is attainable
  - ["Stop before you get exhausted" & "Do less than you think you can"](https://youtu.be/rXUuStdMeoE?si=tO6IN3r7dgBSA1TY&t=5019) is the strategy here.
