I think having a good understanding of your problem space results in higher quality & more valuable software.

I mostly agree with this. But as seen in [baking domain concepts into code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_vAjX2vHu8&t=1422s) and [ddd & naming](/ddd-naming), you can also take some of these concepts with you to the codebase (solution space)

### Product Engineers
Gergely suggests that product minded engineers should be in tune
with what makes the business tick:
