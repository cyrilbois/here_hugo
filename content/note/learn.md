## Summary
- I deeply value learning time, as it allows me to be self-indulgent, and grow professionally, as a lot of the concepts are transferable to the workplace. it also alleviates the feeling of burn out, because it's the kind of work that's fully in my control.
- Important for a sustainable career imo - I got into software because I'm drawn to the idea of being a lifelong student
- Continuous improvement of my skill is part of what I bring to the table as a professional


## Patterns
- Visual learning & pattern recognition and how that also plays in
  - I recently realised, I don't really understand something until I can 'visualise' it in my head.

## Heuristics & just in time
- aside - self help as a form of heuristics & general wisdom, and not prescriptive advice/instructions
  - I like to learn heuristics, and apply judgement on a case by case basis, **just in time**
  - While on this topic, I found a good conversation about how to think about frameworks for decision making. You will always have to adapt to the environment around you, and frameworks are just a guiding principle

## Mental Models
Mental models, how are those related to heuristics? [fs.blog/mental-models](http://fs.blog/mental-models)

## Misc
- Hands on
- immersion
- different forms of media


> [“When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.” John T.
