# Who’s the User

I like to organise information in playlists, or tags. It allows me to contain narrowly scoped projects.

If I’m studying a new language, I create a playlist with all the useful resources I find out over time

Over time, you could potentially build up to hundreds of playlists, each acting as an atomic pocket of information.
It’s essential to be able to manage & prune these playlists easily.

# User Story #1 - Dedicated **Playlists** URL

much like the [watchlater playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL), [subscriptions feed](https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions), & [history feed](https://www.youtube.com/feed/history), it’d be nice to have a dedicated top level page, that shows all your playlists.

### Value
- This will act as the main entry point for managing your playlist collection.
- Presents an alternative way to browse a curated feed, one that you have full control over.
- Minimises distractions, because in this space, you aren’t really in curation mode, you’re choosing from a library of trusted history, your own taste, experience, and curiosity.

# User Story #2 - Bulk Editing of a playlist

Select multiple videos in a playlist &:

- delete
- add to another playlist

### Value
- Makes it easy to keep your playlists pruned

# User Story #3 - Filter by creator

It would be nice to pop into a playlist and say “hm, show me all the videos from darknet diaries”

### Value
- Useful in those massive, top level playlists. Like 'Software Architecture' is the kind of playlist that can 
have up to hundreds of videos

## Checked out what [creator studio](https://studio.youtube.com) is doing

While writing this, I realised you can also manage playlists from here. This is probably the perfect place to put these product capabilities I’m describing

But at the same time, treating playlists as a first class citizen in the main youtube app would be nice. But alas, youtube likely isn't incentivized to do this, lol.
