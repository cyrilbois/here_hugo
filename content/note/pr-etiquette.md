# as an author
The idea is to make a pull request easy on the reviewer. Another opportunity to reduce [irrelevant cognitive load](/cognitive-load-theory/#2-extraneous-irrelevant-load), and increase profit ðŸ’¸.

This is done by providing as much context as possible.
- Link to ticket
- Link to designs
- A summary of the work done. this can be a few bullet points
- explicitly point out areas you want the reviewer to pay close attention to
- steps to reproduce (if itâ€™s a bugfix)

Michael Lynch has great articles about code review. He shares [How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/)

## Naming Conventions
Good naming conventions I've seen exist at branch level, and commit messages.

When naming branches, usually the ticket number alone is enough. You can also prefix them to indicate the type of work being done
eg `bug`, `hotfix`, `feat`, `chore` etc.

Commit messages accompanied with prefixes also provides rich context. [Angular conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) is a good standard to start from.
When done well, good commit messages are an area to provide rich context to your reviewer, it allows one to jump in and out of points of interest, and give more insight into how you came to your eventual solution.

Two articles on the topic:
