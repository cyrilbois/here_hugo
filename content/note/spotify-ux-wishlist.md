## Search for playlist when adding new track
I'd like to start this on a high note, celebrating a big quality of life UX item that was recently shipped.

The Ability to search for a playlist when adding a new track. This first shipped to mobile, and made for easier curating on the phone.
Means I didn't have to organise my playlists in a hierarchy of folders so much anymore, and could just rely on search to quickly find the playlist I need to add to. Quite handy when handling ~300 playlists :)

- The search is kind of fuzzy too! Another little nice to have
> Fuzzy searches are also used for Structured Query Language lookups to help database users find records without having to be sure of the exact spelling of the value they're looking for. [src](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/fuzzy-search)
