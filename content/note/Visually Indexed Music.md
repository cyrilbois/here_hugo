Something I've overheard myself tell friends over and over:
> You know, I suck at remembering names. I hardly remember artists' exact names or song names.
> Album artwork is what I remember more vividly, therefore use that to find the music.

Just before I wrote this, there's an album I really felt like listening to, but I could not remember any strings to grep for it by.

All I knew was the album cover is red. That's a much smaller list to sift through (compared to the list of all my albums). I think it would have helped me find the album quicker.
