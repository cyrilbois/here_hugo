Indecision can be more costly than making the wrong decision.
In other words, you're better off making a choice sooner rather than later.

## Not always, though
Sometimes though, you need to take your time with a decision.
Identify whether or not it's a trap-door decision, or reversible.
A lot of decisions in tech are reversible, optionality is part of the luxury we're afforded.
