## Utilitarian use of music
Since 2013, Spotify has been marketing music with a utilitarian approach. You can tell from the names of their playlists.
This was already seen in Songza, in 2012.

### side-effect
this has also affected how other curators present their music, from the type of playlist images & filters used, to the name & description. 

## how to get there
**Search > Mood > See All**

### mood management is a big part of Spotify's business

If memory serves me correct, I read in an interview somewhere that the way he likes to listen to music is in his bed, laying on his back, eyes closed, doing nothing but listening to the music.

### I recently switched off autoplay
On all my devices. I enjoy the quiet moment that comes at the end of a body of music, instead of the neverending stream. Sometimes I'll just carry on with work in silence and that's cool too.
