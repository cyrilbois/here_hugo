- Uses [templates](https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/awscoursedemos/0058-aws-simplecfn/ec2instance.yaml)
  - Resources is the only mandatory part of a template
  - The outputs section of a template, I found that quite interesting. I wonder how those can be useful
- Templates are used to create stacks
  - Stacks are a logical & physical representation of the resources specified by the template
