# [Tom's definition of a riff](https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/02/10/riffs/)
> - An inquisitive title, something that is not “the ultimate guide” but more “some notes on…”
> - A few references - connecting the dots between some links, quotes from other sources
> - An anecdote from your own work that provides rich texture and context for what you do
> - Some open questions that invite people to
> - A deliberate small list of 3-5 people you can send the post to

# [Andy's principles of evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C)
- Atomic
- Concept oriented
- densely linked
- written for yourself by default, disregarding audience

# Similarities & differences
> [The big differences seem to be the motivation, but the execution shares similar principles.](/andy)

According to my understanding, Tom writes from the lens of an independent consultant. he needs to generate leads, at the same time doesn't want to rely on *classical* content marketing approaches alone.

Andy on the other hand is writing for research, and has decided to make a large portion (all?) of his notes public. That said, there are a lot of similarities, some I may not even be aware of.

- Tom mentions explicitly that riffs keep notes small. Atomic, like Andy says
- One says a few references, the other says densely linked. I believe there's a magic middle, different for each note of course.
- Small list of people vs writing for yourself by default share the same benefits. Small list of people is usually people you trust with first draft & unpolished writing, people that help you workshop & shape your ideas. Also relieves the pressure of getting things right the first time, or trying to write digestible/publishable work off the bat - this can be a distraction in the initial stages of ideation/exploration. Usually good to treat them as separate activities.
