- [Max BÃ¶ck (mxb.dev)](https://mxb.dev/)
- [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/) - no fluff, straight to the point. Overwhelming big wall of text, but I love it! not the easiest to navigate content, but a cool place to hangout nonetheless. You can `Tab` through the content, that way you get the links highlighted
- [jmalvarez's site](https://www.jmalvarez.dev/)
- [I'm Jack McDade and I'm tired of boring websites.](https://www.jackmcdade.com/) - love the monospace font here, code-saver.
- [monobooth](https://moonbooth.com/hugo/) - love the colors, and typography here
- [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/)
- [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/)
- [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/)
- [Carol.gg](https://carol.gg/) - I like the design and feel of this site.
