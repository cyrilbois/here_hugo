- [Max Böck (mxb.dev)](https://mxb.dev/)
- [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/) - no fluff, straight to the point. Overwhelming big wall of text, but I love it! not the easiest to navigate content, but a cool place to hangout nonetheless. You can `Tab` through the content, that way you get the links highlighted
- [jmalvarez's site](https://www.jmalvarez.dev/)
- [I'm Jack McDade and I'm tired of boring websites.](https://www.jackmcdade.com/) - love the monospace font here, code-saver.
