- [300 times a day](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/300-times-a-day/) - This inspired me to further simplify my writing workflow. I agree with what he says about bear being so simple, all you can do when in there is write. Keeps you from procrastinating by tinkering with the tools. I was in the process of trying out Obsidian again, and at the back of my mind thought about how I’ll need to invest some time to customise it and all that. Realistically, that’s not something I can really afford to make time for. Long story short, I’m replacing obsidian with Bear.
