# what i learnt
* i like to think i somewhat improved on my context switching. with the use of workana, and well separated task lists, plus project specific notes to refer to. 
* difference between client-only/focused architecture & server side firebase (`admin-sdk`) became clearer.
  * Shaun even mentioned this in today's backend sync
* my initial estimate for how long the project would take was way way off. 
* when outsourcing work, youâ€™re better off getting the entity youâ€™re outsourcing to on a separate contract with your client. that way youâ€™re not responsible for people management, or their deadlines etc. 
## what i liked 
* first production project with firebase! 
* had a place to write new features, in a time when most sigma work was _chore_ like. 
* was cool to go end to end with a product. from initial chat, to user stories, research on architecture, then implementing. 
	* going from client vision, in an unfamiliar domain to me, to an application they were happy with, lovely feeling.
* always fun to work with tailwind. 
* i had a healthy git workflow, good balance between working directly in main, and short lived feature branches. 
* client pays on time ðŸš€ 
## what i disliked 
* felt like working two jobs, the cognitive load was a bitch.
	* it meant putting in time early morning before work, or early evenings after work
	* this has put me off freelance work for a while, i have earned the rest. 
* my rates were way lower than _market_ - consolation for this is all the stuff i learnt along the way though. 
	* this may have been a result of my completely off estimate. as it was project & deliverable based pricing, as opposed to hourly billing. 
* noticeably less time for loved ones, as most of my free time was dedicated to side gig work. 
* having to do design was a pain. attempt at outsourcing it was unsuccessful & set me back an extra 2 weeks at least. it was then when i decided to roll up my sleeves & get into it. 
* I got really worn out about 2 months into the project, considering I had academic obligations too, my plate was filled to the brim.
## ideas & actions 
* work on personal projects or open source for the rest of the year, and possibly beyond - no need for client pressure.
