# Why the scope of this case study
- I curate music
- I decided ahead of time that I want to share curated music on Instagram stories
- Most of my music consumption is via streaming platforms (Youtube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Mixcloud, Spotify, Tidal)

> Exploring the intersection between software and music

In a nutshell, it's self indulgent research, I'm trying to make life easier for myself, reduce the amount of friction I face when I want to share music, also have the end result in a manner that's easily consumable - that's why I also care about how the end result looks.

# What form/bodies of music do I share?
- [Single tracks]({{<ref "/tags/track">}})
- [DJ mixes by myself & others]({{<ref "/tags/dj">}})
- [Playlists]({{<ref "/tags/playlist">}})
- [Albums]({{<ref "/tags/album">}})
- [Artists]({{<ref "/tags/artist">}})

# Tidal
- Was the fastest feeling
- Has a custom UI flow for sharing, and it feels most optimised for sharing to Instagram Stories

# Spotify
*disclaimer: I worry that my spotify comparisons might not be an accurate representation of the app's UX, my Spotify library is massive, and I know that contributes to a UI that feels slower in some instances, like waiting for "liked songs" to load takes a while, as theres over 6500 of them.*


- A decent custom flow as well

# YouTube music 
- sucks.
- The app doesnâ€™t have a custom share flow, relies on the built in apple share UI, just like regular YouTube does
