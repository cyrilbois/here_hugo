# Why the scope of this case study
- I curate music
- I decided ahead of time that I want to share curated music on Instagram stories
- Most of my music consumption is via streaming platforms (Youtube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Mixcloud, Spotify, Tidal)

> Exploring the intersection between software and music

In a nutshell, it's self indulgent research, I'm trying to make life easier for myself, reduce the amount of friction I face when I want to share music, also have the end result in a manner that's easily consumable - that's why I also care about how the end result looks.

# What form/bodies of music do I share?
- [Single tracks]({{<ref "/tags/track">}})
- [DJ mixes by myself & others]({{<ref "/tags/dj">}})
- [Playlists]({{<ref "/tags/playlist">}})
- [Albums]({{<ref "/tags/album">}})
- [Artists]({{<ref "/tags/artist">}})

# Tidal
- Was the fastest feeling
- Has a custom UI flow for sharing, and it feels most optimised for sharing to Instagram Stories
- End result is purely visual, no clickable link to take you straight to the sound, which is a problem for the end user. now I must manually open my music app and search for the song - not good enough.

# Spotify
*disclaimer: I worry that my spotify comparisons might not be an accurate representation of the app's UX, my Spotify library is massive, and I know that contributes to a UI that feels slower in some instances, like waiting for "liked songs" to load takes a while, as theres over 6500 of them.*

- A decent custom flow for sharing
- Not as fast as Tidal
- Dedicated share to instagram story
- End result has a "Play on spotify" option

# YouTube music 
- sucks for sharing to IG.

# Bandcamp
*disclaimer: Bandcamp UX is generally quirky & can feel a little dated. But I still can't help but love it & its flaws. Has a minimalist, "here for the music & not much else" feeling to it.*

- Can't share to instagram stories, as it only shares link text
- no visual element to their sharing

# Soundcloud
- Easy to share to IG stories
- Feels fast enough
- Includes a clickable link on the story

# Mixcloud
- The video lied, no audio goes over to instagram stories
- Just a gif with album art
- Purely visual end result, no clickable link
