may be a bit of a reach here, but i feel like my natural, unforced interest in these topics all points to design as a fundamental layer. 

* system architecture 
* ux research
    * also link to the note about ux going beyond just websites. 
    * today i had to bend down to scan a barcode on a banner in a cafe. while that’s not the worst thing in the world, and i had no problem doing it, i feel that may be a bad user experience for someone who’s even slightly physically impaired. make your products as easy to use as possible for your end user. 
* good ui design and how it’s coupled to solid ux. how the two complement each other. 
    * Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger make a good illustration of this
* I want to read martin fowler’s refactoring, but in my experience, refactoring code is a form of continuous improvement on the overall design of your code.
* don’t even get me started on the pleasant ux you’re given by Apple products.

## An objectively good UI is a byproduct of solid UX
A typical UX checklist when developing a digital product (by no means a conclusive list) might look something like this:
  - [Accisibility](https://www.checklist.design/topics/accessibility)
  - [Typography](https://www.checklist.design/topics/typography)
  - [Writing](https://www.checklist.design/topics/ux-writing)
**loosely related:** [ux myths](https://uxmyths.com/)
I hope this demonstrates why I think you can't make a *'good'* UI, without a well thought out UX to back it up.

  - video games
  - web app
  - desktop app
  - smart TV
- UI: User Interface
- UX: User Experience
