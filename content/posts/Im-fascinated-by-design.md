may be a bit of a reach here, but i feel like my natural, unforced interest in these topics all points to design as a fundamental layer. 

* system architecture 
* ux research
    * also link to the note about ux going beyond just websites. 
    * today i had to bend down to scan a barcode on a banner in a cafe. while that’s not the worst thing in the world, and i had no problem doing it, i feel that may be a bad user experience for someone who’s even slightly physically impaired. make your products as easy to use as possible for your end user. 
    * also link to the good ux books i’ve read 
    * design of everyday objects 
    * don’t make me think
* good ui design and how it’s coupled to solid ux. how the two complement each other. 
    * adam wathans & steve schoger make a good illustration of this
* I want to read martin fowler’s refactoring, but in my experience, refactoring code is a form of continuous improvement on the overall design of your code.
* don’t even get me started on the pleasant ux you’re given by Apple products.
