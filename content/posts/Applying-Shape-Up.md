description: I read shape up a year or two ago, and I'm applying some of the principles taught, in how I manage my own workload. I only work on 1 'other' project at a time, outside of my daily work commitments
tldr: I only work on 1 'other' project at a time, outside of my daily work commitments.

## Some points from Shape up
One of the biggest takeaways from Shape Up, is how the teams would go into [6 week cycles](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#six-week-cycles) of uninterrupted work. 
- A project is [shaped]({{<ref shape-up-notes-shaping>}}), [appetite]({{<ref "shape-up-notes-introduction#appetite">}}) is decided, then work starts.
- Appetite is how much time you're choosing to commit to a shaped project. Meaning the uninterrupted cycles can range from 2 weeks, to 6 weeks.
- Down time is also planned like this, after a 6 week cycle, you've got 2 weeks where you don't do shaped work. it's a time to rest, reflect, & work on bugs or whatever else had been 'put aside' while in that 6 weeks of laser sharp focus
- Work is also planned in [vertical slices](), meaning the 'end to end' of the project is developed in that 6 week sprint. that would translate into a team with a designer, & 2 full stack engineers, or a designer, frontend engineer, & backend engineer.

## How I'm applying it
- Because I have daily commitments to [Sigma](), it limits the time I can spend working on other stuff.
- I've decided to **only work on 1 other project** outside of [Sigma]() work.
- It has to be **shaped**, & **appetite decided beforehand**.
- This is mostly because context switching is expensive for me, I've gotten much better at it, but it wears me out quicker than a mf. I like to work with large uninterrupted blocks of time, so if I have too much going on, I'll get nowhere fast.
- This also allows me to capture the natural ebbs & flows of energy, if I miss out on side-project work today, it's okay because it's the only thing I'm committed to for a few weeks. so there'll always be time to catch up after a good rest. less pressure.
- There's so many projects that need attention, so I decide on appetite, and that's the only other project that has my attention till the end of a cycle. At the time of writing, that project is [pro-search](https://pro-search.io). Still very early days, so we'll see how it goes.

## wearing many hats
- As I'm in a 6 week cycle of [pro-search], I'm also passively shaping up the next project, a migration for [DIFTK]. Collecting the resources I'll need, & doing general alignment with [Terry]. This will probably be a small batch cycle.
- Also have [Dataecho] work at the back of my mind, have to shape up a cycle, this one will be interesting as I have a new teammate to work with, [Vic] :)
  - Another project I'm passively shaping up, collecting feedback from the client, and will then get to how workload will be split, plus the appetite.
