> the idea of regulatory capture is a special interest groups, or in this case, let's say, developers, we got a politician say like, hey, if you want to call yourself an engineer, or developer, you need to get this federal certification. And this certification costs $20,000. Because it's worth it, we get paid a lot of money. So politicians like yeah, that's, that's right. Probably everybody shouldn't be engineer. So let's create this special permitting process and all those things. So then, right there, we've created ready regulatory capture only people who can afford to pay this bar and cross this hurdle and pass this test that we've established, can become engineers.
