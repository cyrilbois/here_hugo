- isn't just dub techno
- has contrast
	- some minimal, or something similar
- that allows you to appreciate the space that's in the sound of dub techno
- if it's just dub through & through your ears begin to tune it out - so it's good to mix out and back into dub techno

**can I find any mixes that meet this description?**
