# The Dub monitor video
**7 minutes 40 seconds in is where he talks about it**

### To summarise, he says a good dub techno mix
- isn't just dub techno
- has contrast
	- some minimal, or similar & complementing genres
- that allows you to appreciate the space that's in the sound of dub techno
- if it's just dub through & through your ears begin to tune it out - so it's good to mix out and back into dub techno

# This principle applies beyond just Dub Techno
The same logic can be applied across many genres. Regardless of what you play, you have to manage energy in a mix.

Ronny explains it really well in the video below - bit of a long one, but a must watch for any DJ

# Practical tip to take away
**TLDR: making a focused & well curated playlist in preparation for a set makes it easier to manage energy**

I spent time curating a playlist for a minimal dnb set, and it was made of old favourites, that I knew the sound & energy of, pretty well. 

When playing the set, it felt a lot easier to manage the energy on the fly. I was confindently going in & out of tracks as I felt fit.
