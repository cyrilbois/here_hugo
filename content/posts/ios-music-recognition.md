Shazam is a tool that's deeply embedded in my curating efforts.

shazam works using the microphone, listening out for sounds in your physical space.

now, that's a problem because a lot of my time listening to music is in my headphones, meaning no shazam. ios music recognition solves this by also recording the playback going through your bluetooth hardware. 

meaning you can shazam music in your headphones without needing to disconnect bluetooth & play it out loud.
