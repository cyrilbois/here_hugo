# Echospace - The Coldest Season
{{<spotifyembed album 6inU6drg77x3bgkN2OpDq6>}}

# Plastikman, Richie Hawtin - Consumed
first listen, opening track sounds strong. calm, long running, & deep pulse.
{{<spotifyembed album 1U7aY4kI9xeMuI3nD4LKBy>}}

# Robert Hood - Internal Empire
quickly sampled a few tracks, sounds glitchy, & fast, slightly hardcore too. definitely worth a full listen, maybe while working out.

# Sandwell District - Feed Forward
a classic, in my eyes. my favourites include **Immolare**, **SVAR - Graz Version**, **Immolare - Studio**, and of course **Grey Cut Out**. the sound engineering in Sandwell District's work is incredible.

# Efdemin - Decay
**Subatomic** sounds nice, definitely giving the full album a listen. sounds suitable to play during work hours too.

# Mathimidori - Akebono
~~not the most solid first impression~~(quickly changed when I sampled two more tracks), but can be sampled in full when working. very dub technoey, **Shao** sounds cool for sure. opening track has a nice thud to it.

{{<spotifyembed album 2GisvCwVDI4cUekPU1gkqX>}}
