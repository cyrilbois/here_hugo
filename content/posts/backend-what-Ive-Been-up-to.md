description: summary of the backend work I've been doing in the last few weeks
tags: [backend, retro]
---

- just finished a [firebase & nextjs project](/dataecho-retro).
- been reading [accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) 
    * getting exposed to the *why* of iaas & dev ops
* design patterns, interesting time to pick them up, easier to understand now that I have more hours of actual coding under my belt.
    * lovely [resource](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc) shared by [Dan](https://github.com/Thunder-Chief)
* bored of the [azure course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/), so i‚Äôm moving on from there
* considering node for a few weeks
    * get more backend experience with node before experimenting with golang?
    * Bakani has suggested i look into nest. 
    
    > it uses decorators like in Angular to do some of the trivial stuff like generating swagger documentation. That for me is the biggest win 

    > And there's better architecture for your code because you separate features into modules etc 


* set up a hugo blog that ive been playing with(this site), exposing me to a bit of golang 

## from shaun, the wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* aws is first preference, all the way
* gcp only if you‚Äôre using firebase and frontend stuff
* dynamo db 
* a comment on design patterns - reactive extensions 
  * rx, observer pattern, angular‚Äôs basically been built on it.
