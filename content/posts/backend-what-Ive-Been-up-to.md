# backend - what i’ve been up to
- been reading accelerate 
    * getting exposed to the *why* of iaas & dev ops
* design patterns. 
    * lovely [resource](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc) shared by [Dan](https://github.com/Thunder-Chief)
* bored of the [azure course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/), so i’m moving on from there
* considering node for a few weeks
    * get more backend experience with node before experimenting with golang?
    * Bakani has suggested i look into nest. 
    > it uses decorators like in Angular to do some of the trivial stuff like generating swagger documentation. That for me is the biggest win 

    > And there's better architecture for your code because you separate features into modules etc 


* set up a hugo blog that ive been playing with(this site), exposing me to a bit of golang 

## from shaun
* aws is first preference, all the way
* gcp only if you’re using firebase and frontend stuff
* dynamo db 
* a comment on design patterns - reactive extensions 
  * rx, observer pattern, angular’s basically been built on it.
