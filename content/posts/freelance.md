Inspired & borrowing from [Cameron Cabo](https://www.cameroncabo.com/freelance). quoted are points that resonate closely:

# What I do well
- Build, test, & maintain frontend applications at all stages of their lifecycle
	- Slowly leaning into fullstack products
- Strategic & technical advisory.

> - All of my work keeps to similar practices allowing for rapid prototyping.
> - Every project is personalized to your budget, timeframe, and specifications.

# Compensation
- Only taking up projects that allow for hourly based billing at the moment.
> If you work for a non-profit or a similarly mission-driven organization, send me an email and we can go from there. (I've put over 50hrs at this point into [DIFTK](https://doit4thekidz.org))

> you only pay for the work that I put directly into product: hours spent on learning and preliminary research are on me.

# Past projects
