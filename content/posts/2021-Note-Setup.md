description: Obsidian, icloud Notes, Hugo, Git
tldr: evolving the way I capture my ideas, with the goal of simplifying it further.

evolving from this ['old']({{<ref the-way-my-notes-are-setup>}}) setup.

## main editor
- VS Code: for the terminal so I can use hugo archetypes to quickly create new files, + to handle version control.
- Obsidian: where I'm trying to do most of my writing

## mobile & quick capture
- iCloud notes: allows for natively captured & shared notes on phone & laptop. little bit of vendor lock in, but that's okay for the quick capture stuff.
	- this is also where I keep journal & personal notes.
- Obsidian mobile

## sync
- iCloud
- Git (ultimately for publishing [guidefari.com](https://guidefari.com))
- Obsidian Sync (so I can have the website's `md` files on mobile too)
