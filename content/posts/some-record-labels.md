## Deep House
- Stay true sounds
- Just move records
- All Day I Dream: I remember bingeing their releases for quite a while, fun times. I still enjoy the nostalgic feeling some of their releases still give me. Their sound head heavy influence on the direction of the [Portable Sunsets]({{<ref portable-sunsets>}}) playlist.
- Oh So Coy & Rogue Decibels

## Drum n Bass
- Hospital Records: this label is the one that really cemented my love for the genre. Tony's podcast was very influencial to the sounds I listen to now. 
- Med School Music: Can't talk about Hospital Records & leave out the sister label, Med School. A lot of my liquid & neurofunk favourites were discovered here
- Microfunk: A label I discovered through Hospital Records, as they're the one's who introduced me to Bop.

## Mixed bag
- Warp records
- Hypnus
-
