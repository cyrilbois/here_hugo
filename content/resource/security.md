- OSINT : Open source intelligence gathering. practiced by lots of security personnel, at various stages of whatever security jobs they're working. 

- APT: Advanced Persistent Threat

- Botnet: the one i just heard about was taken down by bringing down the command & control servers. this was done by collaborating with the dns provider for the domain names that the command and control serve

### Attackers with good operations security
{{<youtube zXmZnU2GdVk>}}
- botnet active between 2005 - 2015/16
- over 500 000 infected machines
- the black hat team had an interesting network topology set up, they wouldn't just connect to the internet. to reach the **command & control server**,each member of the team was given a pre-configured router & antenna, which they'd use to steal wifi from people within a 1.5 mile radius, proxy through at least 3 infected machines, & only then communicate with CnC. this is just one layer of their OpSec ðŸ™Œ
- they also had an interesting & automated election process, to choose which infected machines were good enough to be used as proxies
- Attackers had a pretty good automation game, over the years they automated people out of jobs with the org, and in turn became more secure

**Verdict**: to sum it up, a really interesting video.
