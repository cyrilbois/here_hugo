Mini podcast series, with short & digestable insights on the 10 principles of building a second brain. it's approx' 10 minutes per episode.

There's also a second season, going over some myths about building a second brain.

{{<spotifyembed show 40O0Lbp5ockSt0qSogo6q1>}}

## the principles

1. Borrowed creativity
2. The capture habit
3. Idea recycling
4. Projects over categories
5. Slow burns: stop completing your work via "heavy lifts"
6. Start with abundance. I feel this one is closely related to slow burns
7. Intermediate packets: making small contained & digestible units of work that can be re-used/transformed in the future.
8. You only know what you make: don't just passively learn, put to action what you're learning
9. Make things easier for your future self (Progressive summarization)
10. Keep your ideas moving
