description: this term has been referred to enough times around me, for me to want to understand what it means.

* my first encounter with `sagas` was via `Redux`. [this](https://hackernoon.com/redux-saga-tutorial-for-beginners-and-dog-lovers-aa69a17db645) tutorial was a lovely intro. But when the term `Sagas` started being used as a way to think of how the architecture of a new ecosystem of products would be structured/built, I knew I had to dive deeper into finding out what a saga is really.
* was good to get exposed to the thinking of `choreography` vs `orchestration`

* links & videos will be on Redux sagas, & sagas as an architecture pattern for microservices & managing distributed transactions.

* **def:** a transaction is a set of operations that is 'all or nothing' - meaning either all of the operations are executed/applied, or none of them are. explained better by [these SQL docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/transactions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15).
  * I also linked to a video on `ACID transactions` - *intro to DBs refresher ðŸ˜‰*
