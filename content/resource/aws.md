# Solutions Architect
#### could use 
- the freecodecamp video 
- [syllabus](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf), 
- a reference book, a good [certification guide](https://www.informit.com/store/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02-9780137325214).
- then do practice questions/exams at the end of it, till I'm confident enough to take the actual exam.
- make sure to do labs for each topic.
