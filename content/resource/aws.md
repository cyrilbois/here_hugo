## DynamoDB

> The main reason for using a single table in DynamoDB is to retrieve multiple, heterogenous item types using a single request.

- {{<youtube KYy8X8t4MB8>}}
- **GSI**: Global Secondary Indexes. A way to further partition your data, to make for more efficient queries. [docs here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.html). Useful as your access patterns get more complex.
- **Index Overloading:**
- **RCU**: Read Capacity Units
- **WCU**: Write Capacity Units

#### The downsides of single table design

Taken from the [source](https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-single-table/) of the quote above.

1. It can be **difficult to add new access patterns**
1. **Difficulty of analytics**

## DevOps

> DevOps is the combination of **cultural philosophies**, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to **deliver applications and services at high velocity**: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using **traditional software development and infrastructure management processes**. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

### Blue/Green deployment

Can also be referred to as `A/B deployment` where two identical hardware environments, where 1 remains idle, & the other is active & serving end users.

- [ ] How can this be achieved on AWS?

#### Questions to answer from the labs

- what is continuous delivery & its benefits
- CodeCommit & MFA
- IAM - need to do a deep dive on this
