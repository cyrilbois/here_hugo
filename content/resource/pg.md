## Essays I've enjoyed

- [Do things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)

random snippets from it:
>Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound on user experience, it's interesting in a very pleasant way to think about how far you could go to delight your users.

> Over-engaging with early users is not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling. For most successful startups it's a necessary part of the feedback loop that makes the product good.

> Back when hardware startups had to rely on investors for money, you had to be pretty convincing to overcome this. The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely, preorders) has helped a lot.

- [how to start a start up](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html)
- {{<youtube ii1jcLg-eIQ>}}

- [how to work hard](http://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html) - read this while on a long bus trip. I'd read a few paragraphs, stop, reflect, daydream, & repeat. was fun:)
- [A project of one's own](http://paulgraham.com/own.html) - ever notice that a lot of people in tech are likely to have side projects they're super excited about? this essay breaks that down well.
- [The other half of "Artists ship"](http://paulgraham.com/artistsship.html) - an essay on the cost of 'process' & 'checks' in an org
