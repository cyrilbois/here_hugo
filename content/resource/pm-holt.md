## On variety of work
> [I am rarely bored at work. There are certainly tedious things, and a day full of end-to-end meetings can be tough, but I get to engage in so many aspects of product development that it keeps me engaged. I get to dabble in design, development, UX research, people management, resource allocations, recruiting, administration, legal, accounting, etc.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/what-is-product-management/why-you-might-want-to-be-a-pm)

## Money related code 
> [a very real problem I faced at Stripe: developers really do not like changing code that deals with money and for good reason: bugs cost real money.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/stakeholder-management/why)

# Principles of good communication in Product Management

## Audience
> [Know who you are writing to. How you write a memo to be consumed by everyone at a 10,000 person company will be wildly different than a memo sent to executive leadership. How you run standup for a group of engineers will differ from a gathering of product managers.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

> [A big part of the audience you are speaking with is knowing what you want from them](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

And on a related note

> [By highlighting points of unknowns, you can invite your audience to help share the context you are looking for.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

## Context Setting
> [You need to give your audience just enough context for them to be able to make a decision](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/say-less)

Minimal viable context, if you may.

> [If some of the people know it and it's important to your message, give a short summary and link to somewhere they can acquire more context.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/say-less)

## Reduce the surface area
You want to keep your conversations focused, & on topic. Only share what is necessary
Meetings that get derailed can be ineffective.

## Don't convince people who don't need convincing
Say less.

## Technical writing is different from novels or essays
Keep it effective and efficient.

## On Preparation
> [a lot of the work you do will never be visible to anyone, and that is okay](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/say-less)

## How engaged are your typical readers?
> [rarely a reader will take more than five minutes to read a doc. One to two is a pretty engaged reader. Five minutes is a highly engaged reader.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/technical-writing/applying-previous-principles)

## Diagrams
Well made diagrams allow you to organise & tell a story in a way very hard to do with words. Use these skillfully.

## [Executive Summary](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/technical-writing/executive-summaries)
Start your docs with these. it places important details upfront.
This is another effective way to do context setting.

You can even use a hook to grab their attention. Is this clickbait? I think not,
if you aren't actually bullshittingðŸ˜†

Stripe calls these sections **BLUF** - Bottom Line Up Front

# Running effective meetings

## Communicate your intention
> [What do you want from the meeting? What do others need from it? What is success? What would be a waste of people's time?... It allows you to set an agenda. It also allows you to say, "We have an objective in this time slot, and we are getting off-topic."](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/meetings/meeting-prep)

## No Agenda, no attenda
For important meetings, send the agenda out beforehand.

## [Timeboxing](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/meetings/meeting-prep)
Timebox key topics to keep discussions from derailing or going on longer than they should.

## Come in with a decision made
> [Meetings where you make decisions by committee, where someone comes in, presents a bunch of info, and then asks, "What do you all think" suck. It always ends up with the loudest voices in the room dominating and frequently ends up with someone's opinion as the solution rather than the room's consensus. Don't do that. Instead, make a decision yourself. It's your meeting, do all the research, and come in with an opinion in your presentation.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/meetings/meeting-prep)

## Own the flow of the meeting
> [Generally, you want to control the flow of the meeting. People should regard you as being the meeting runner, and you should lean into that. A good rule of thumb is to not pass off the presentation to someone else when it can be avoided. Ask them to chime in, but you should be the one presenting.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/meetings/running-the-meeting)

## Tangents
These can be the most impactful part of a meeting. But can also be be
a massive distraction of someone indulging themselves.
Up to your discretion on which is which. 

- Lean on agenda + timeboxing to steer the conversation back into control, if need be.
- Another option is to request an async thread to be started to capture a tangent.

> [Don't be afraid to interrupt anyone. Occasionally, they may push back and say, "This is important. Let's discuss now," but more often than not, they'll respect the agenda.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/meetings/running-the-meeting).

Semi related is [inoculation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation_theory).
> The idea is that if you know this thing is going to come up, address it first before the person can bring it up.

# Metrics

## Stats
> [you should learn some basic stats as a PM. It will help you understand what is happening and be able to storytell with numbers better.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/metrics/stats-and-graphs)

## Sampling
A truly random sample is representative of the whole. Getting a truly random sample
of your users to run experiments with, you'll get a better rounded view of what helps and what doesn't.

> [Your NPS is always lower than you think, because customers who already churned arenâ€™t answering the quiz. Neither are the disengaged people. Double selection bias. - Jason Cohen](https://twitter.com/asmartbear/status/1721432985663152301)

## p-value
> [A p-value can be thought of: "How confident are we in this statement."](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/metrics/stats-and-graphs)

## Graphs
Similar to diagrams, use these only when relevant, and to drive a point home.
Choose an appropriate one for the story you're trying to communicate.
