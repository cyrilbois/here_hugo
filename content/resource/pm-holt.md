## On variety of work
> [I am rarely bored at work. There are certainly tedious things, and a day full of end-to-end meetings can be tough, but I get to engage in so many aspects of product development that it keeps me engaged. I get to dabble in design, development, UX research, people management, resource allocations, recruiting, administration, legal, accounting, etc.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/what-is-product-management/why-you-might-want-to-be-a-pm)

## Money related code 
> [a very real problem I faced at Stripe: developers really do not like changing code that deals with money and for good reason: bugs cost real money.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/stakeholder-management/why)

# Principles of good communication in Product Management

## Audience
> [Know who you are writing to. How you write a memo to be consumed by everyone at a 10,000 person company will be wildly different than a memo sent to executive leadership. How you run standup for a group of engineers will differ from a gathering of product managers.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

> [A big part of the audience you are speaking with is knowing what you want from them](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

And on a related note

> [By highlighting points of unknowns, you can invite your audience to help share the context you are looking for.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

## Context Setting
> [You need to give your audience just enough context for them to be able to make a decision](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/say-less)

Minimal viable context, if you may.

> [If some of the people know it and it's important to your message, give a short summary and link to somewhere they can acquire more context.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/say-less)

## Reduce the surface area
You want to keep your conversations focused, & on topic. Only share what is necessary
Meetings that get derailed can be ineffective.

## Don't convince people who don't need convincing
Say less.

## Technical writing ia different from novels or essays
Keep it effective and efficient
