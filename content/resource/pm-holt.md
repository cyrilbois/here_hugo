## On variety of work
> [I am rarely bored at work. There are certainly tedious things, and a day full of end-to-end meetings can be tough, but I get to engage in so many aspects of product development that it keeps me engaged. I get to dabble in design, development, UX research, people management, resource allocations, recruiting, administration, legal, accounting, etc.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/what-is-product-management/why-you-might-want-to-be-a-pm)

## Money related code 
> [a very real problem I faced at Stripe: developers really do not like changing code that deals with money and for good reason: bugs cost real money.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/stakeholder-management/why)

# Principles of good communication in Product Management

## Audience
> [Know who you are writing to. How you write a memo to be consumed by everyone at a 10,000 person company will be wildly different than a memo sent to executive leadership. How you run standup for a group of engineers will differ from a gathering of product managers.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

> [A big part of the audience you are speaking with is knowing what you want from them](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

And on a related note

> [By highlighting points of unknowns, you can invite your audience to help share the context you are looking for.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/audience)

## Context Setting
> [You need to give your audience just enough context for them to be able to make a decision](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/say-less)

Minimal viable context, if you may.

> [If some of the people know it and it's important to your message, give a short summary and link to somewhere they can acquire more context.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/say-less)

## Reduce the surface area
You want to keep your conversations focused, & on topic. Only share what is necessary
Meetings that get derailed can be ineffective.

## Don't convince people who don't need convincing
Say less.

## Technical writing is different from novels or essays
Keep it effective and efficient.

## On Preparation
> [a lot of the work you do will never be visible to anyone, and that is okay](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/communication/say-less)

## How engaged are your typical readers?
> [rarely a reader will take more than five minutes to read a doc. One to two is a pretty engaged reader. Five minutes is a highly engaged reader.](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/technical-writing/applying-previous-principles)

## Diagrams
Well made diagrams allow you to organise & tell a story in a way very hard to do with words. Use these skillfully.

## [Executive Summary](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/technical-writing/executive-summaries)
Start your docs with these. it places important details upfront.
This is another effective way to do context setting.

You can even use a hook to grab their attention. Is this clickbait? I think not,
if you aren't actually bullshittingðŸ˜†

Stripe calls these sections **BLUF** - Bottom Line Up Front

# Running effective meetings

## Communicate your intention
> [What do you want from the meeting? What do others need from it? What is success? What would be a waste of people's time?... It allows you to set an agenda. It also allows you to say, "We have an objective in this time slot, and we are getting off-topic."](https://pm.holt.courses/lessons/meetings/meeting-prep)

## No Agenda, no attenda
For important meetings, send the agenda out beforehand.

## Timeboxing
Timebox key topics to keep discussions from derailing or going on longer than they should.

## Come in with a decision made
> Meetings where you make decisions by committee, where someone comes in, presents a bunch of info, and then asks, "What do you all think" suck. It always ends up with the loudest voices in the room dominating and frequently ends up with someone's opinion as the solution rather than the room's consensus. Don't do that. Instead, make a decision yourself. It's your meeting, do all the research, and come in with an opinion in your presentation.
