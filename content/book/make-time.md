# how time works
## 1. Highlight
- start each day with a single priority
- something you have to do, or want to do
- doesn't have to be the only thing you do in a day
- but it means you've committed to doing all the tasks required to complete that one task
- This is very similar to how Jason Lengstorf introduced me to this kind of thinking. 

## 2. Laser
- beating distractions to make time for your highlight
- things like logging off socials

## 3. Energize
>  - use the body to recharge the brain
>  - charge your battery with exercise, food, sleep, quiet, and face-to-face time.

## 4. Reflect
- make some notes at the end of the day.

# remember
- you don't have to try out all the tactics highlighted in this book at once.
- **Reflecting** is the only non-negotiable, but otherwise, from **highlight**, **laser**, & **energize**, even as little as one per category is good.
	- use the reflecting time to adjust the tactics employed in the other 3 categories, if need be.

# tips on how to choose your highlight
- use urgency as a guideline, but also,
> Look for activities that are not urgent. Instead, consider projects you’ve been meaning to get around to but haven’t quite found the time.

> It's never too late in the day to pick (or change) a **highlight**
