# Nice summary

## There's no DDD without Domain Experts

You need to be committed to building a team around them, and having constructive conversations with them.

## Strategic Design

- Domains
- Subdomain
- Bounded Context
- Ubiquitous Language

# Highlights

### What is DDD
> In short, DDD is primarily about modeling a Ubiquitous Language in an explicitly Bounded Context.

### Bounded Context
> a Bounded Context
> is a semantic contextual boundary. This means that within the boundary each component of the software model has a specific meaning and does specific things.
